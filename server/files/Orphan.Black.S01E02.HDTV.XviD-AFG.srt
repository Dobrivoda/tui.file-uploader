바워즈 박사님말씀하신대로,
사실을 받아들이고 있어요

401
00:37:31,481 --> 00:37:31,600
솔직히, 지금 저에게가장 필요한 건

402
00:37:32,461 --> 00:37:32,580
근무에 복귀하는거에요

403
00:37:34,255 --> 00:37:34,374
지난번 뵀을때형사님은 총쏜걸

404
00:37:37,285 --> 00:37:39,287
기억하지 못하셨죠"제 자신을 놓치고 있어요깜빡거리고

제가 하려는건앞으로 나아가는거에요죄송해요, 베스. 그래도

407
00:37:48,463 --> 00:37:50,832
당신의 정신 상태를 고려하고그 사건에 대해 되집어보고..그건 이제 지난 일이에요
바워즈 박사님

408
00:37:53,067 --> 00:37:54,701
또한 당신 자신이 인정한기억 상실이나 정신적 문제로 인하여근무를 권해드리지 못하겠네요

409
00:37:56,938 --> 00:37:58,739
저한테는 도움이되지 않을겁니다

410
00:38:01,509 --> 00:38:03,510
이해해요당신은 경찰이시니하지만 이게 제 일이에요

411
00:38:05,879 --> 00:38:07,582
그 뒤에꺼 다시 읽어주시겠어요?

412
00:38:09,183 --> 00:38:12,018
그거, 음.."제 자신을 놓치고 있어요
깜빡거리고"

413
00:38:14,321 --> 00:38:15,823
취한 것처럼 들리지 않으세요?

414
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:23,364
"깜빡거린"다는게 취한거라고요?맹맹하고, 덜깨고, 늘어지고

417
00:38:33,174 --> 00:38:34,609

제가 좀 헷갈려서요

418
00:38:36,009 --> 00:38:37,512
제 말은, 아주 헷갈리네요

419
00:38:41,349 --> 00:38:43,417
항우울제, 항불안제SSRI(항우울제 종류)세로트로낙스..
이건 자극제네요

420
00:38:45,686 --> 00:38:46,960
우리가 서로 한동안알고 지냈었는데 지금, 베스..그래요? 거기서 부터
잘못 알고 계시는군요

421
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:48,440
당신이 계속해서개인적으로 처방전을

422
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:50,691
애원하면서절 시험하셨잖아요

423
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,296
알아요제 잘못이죠

424
00:38:56,931 --> 00:38:58,799
그래서 위원회에 가서당신이 이중삼중으로
처방해준 약들을 먹고

425
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:03,639
그 불쌍한 민간인을 쐈다고얘기하려고요

426
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:11,177
아니면 제가 좀 나아졌나요?

427

Hey, it's Sarah.

493
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:03,756
I saw a girl kill herself.

494
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:04,757
Ew!

495
00:00:06,857 --> 00:00:06,859
Yeah, and she lookedexactly like me.

496
00:00:07,958 --> 00:00:07,960

497
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:09,428
I'm going to go up to her flat.

498
00:00:11,829 --> 00:00:11,831
To find out who she is or torob the rest of her shit?

499
00:00:12,781 --> 00:00:12,901
Hello?

500
00:00:14,865 --> 00:00:14,867
She's got $75,000in a savings account.

501
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:16,202
Holy shite.

502
00:00:17,835 --> 00:00:17,837
Beth is a cop.I'm a cop.

503
00:00:20,871 --> 00:00:20,873
Your partner,he was following you.

504
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:22,775
If that was my boyfriend,

505
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:24,443
I'd jump in frontof a train, too.

506
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:26,012
- What's happened?- A lot.

507
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:27,780
Something's different.How was the hearing?

508
00:00:29,146 --> 00:00:29,148
Officer Elizabeth Childs,entering into record

Something's different.

I'm here for Kira, Fe.

513
00:00:40,157 --> 00:00:40,159
You left Kira with Mrs. S...

514
00:00:42,192 --> 00:00:42,194
and you didn't comeback for 10 months!

515
00:00:44,662 --> 00:00:44,664
We have to have, like,a memorial sendoff.

516
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:46,132
No no no,Kira's there.

517
00:00:47,565 --> 00:00:47,567
She can't think I'm dead, Fe.

518
00:00:49,533 --> 00:00:49,535
Beth, it's Katja.

519
00:00:51,068 --> 00:00:51,070
Just one.I'm a few.

520
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:58,344
No family, too.Who am I?

521
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:10,455
Hello?

522
00:01:12,623 --> 00:01:12,625
Beth,where have you been?

523
00:01:14,558 --> 00:01:14,560
Uh, where have I been?

524
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:16,829
Um...

525
00:01:18,262 --> 00:01:18,264
Uh, long story.

526
00:01:19,897 --> 00:01:19,899
Well?

527
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:21,000
Well, what?

528
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:22,602
Did you meet the German?

529
00:01:24,134 --> 00:01:26,838
I can't get a hold of her.

530
00:01:29,106 --> 00:01:29,108
Beth?

531
00:01:30,107 --> 00:01:30,109
What?

532
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:31,510
The German's dead.

533
00:01:32,743 --> 00:01:32,745
Dead?

534
00:01:34,945 --> 00:01:34,947
Yeah, someone shot her,right in front of me!

535
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:36,682
Oh, Jesus!Are you all right?!

536
00:01:38,282 --> 00:01:38,284
No! No, I'm notall right!

537
00:01:39,783 --> 00:01:39,785
She's in the back of my car!

538
00:01:41,325 --> 00:01:41,445
There's blood everywhere!

539
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:44,023
Holy shit. Holyshit, it's true.

540
00:01:45,155 --> 00:01:45,157
What?

541
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:47,293
That someone is killing us.

542
00:01:49,426 --> 00:01:49,428
They must've followedher from Europe.

543
00:01:50,427 --> 00:01:50,429
Jesus

544
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:52,231
bloody Christ!

545
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:53,232
What?

546
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:55,034
Nothing.Nothing, nothing.

547
00:01:56,634 --> 00:01:56,636
Okay, okay, okay. Didyou get the briefcase?

548
00:01:57,635 --> 00:01:57,637
Uh...

549
00:01:58,636 --> 00:01:58,638
Beth?

550
00:01:59,803 --> 00:01:59,805
What?

551
00:02:01,238 --> 00:02:01,240
You know what?Worry about that later.

552
00:02:02,673 --> 00:02:02,675
You need to get ridof the body.

553
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:04,443
- How?- I... I...

554
00:02:05,843 --> 00:02:05,845
Like, how?

555
00:02:07,911 --> 00:02:07,913
I don't know.

556
00:02:10,581 --> 00:02:10,583
You're the cop.Like, buy a shovel.

557
00:02:12,983 --> 00:02:12,985
Just make sureyou get her samples.

558
00:02:14,118 --> 00:02:14,120
Uh... samples?

559
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:17,723
Hair and blood, Beth.

560
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:20,092
You can do this.

561
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:22,228
Uh... how aboutyou come help me?

562
00:02:24,528 --> 00:02:24,530
I would if I could.

563
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:25,898
Look, one step at a time.

564
00:02:27,331 --> 00:02:37,392

565
00:02:41,866 --> 00:03:45,477
Orphan Black 01x02Instinct

566
00:03:49,346 --> 00:03:49,348
Sorry, Elizabeth Childs.

567
00:03:52,015 --> 00:03:52,017
Freaks and punks,

568
00:03:53,383 --> 00:03:53,385
lost puppies...

569
00:03:55,753 --> 00:03:55,755
We always hada friend in Sarah.

570
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:57,656
You have a few words, Felix?

571
00:03:58,722 --> 00:03:58,724
Hmm? Mm.

572
00:04:00,257 --> 00:04:00,259
Anything you want to express?

573
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:02,561
Oh, no, I...I can't, Bob.

574
00:04:04,294 --> 00:04:09,267
I'm too verklempt.

575
00:04:11,301 --> 00:04:11,303
"We're inbummed-out city...

576
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:15,641
I plead your mercyand your pity

577
00:04:19,376 --> 00:04:19,378
is not life

578
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:25,584
a mirror maze?"

579
00:04:27,718 --> 00:04:27,720
To Sarah.

580
00:04:29,086 --> 00:04:30,222
To Sarah!

581
00:04:31,822 --> 00:04:35,293
To Sarah.

582
00:04:38,495 --> 00:04:38,497
I can't figure out

583
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:42,634
why she killed herself.

584
00:04:44,601 --> 00:04:44,603
It's just not Sarah.

585
00:04:46,103 --> 00:04:52,112
It's not Sarah.

586
00:04:55,179 --> 00:04:55,181
Well, at least she had love.

587
00:04:58,282 --> 00:04:58,284
Whose love did she have, yours?

588
00:05:02,619 --> 00:05:02,621
Love  is imperfect.

589
00:05:04,421 --> 00:05:04,423
Love is

590
00:05:06,657 --> 00:05:06,659
imperfection itself.

591
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:08,060
If that's your definition,

592
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:09,862
no wonder she jumped.

593
00:05:11,428 --> 00:05:11,430
Shit!

594
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:13,032
Hey! Whoa whoa, take it easy!

595
00:05:14,331 --> 00:05:14,333
Let him go, Vic!

596
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:16,402
Say it! Go ahead,say it's my fault!

597
00:05:17,601 --> 00:05:17,603
Say it's my fault!

598
00:05:19,937 --> 00:05:19,939
It's... your...

599
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:21,841
Vic! Vic!Be cool.

600
00:05:24,608 --> 00:05:24,610
Aaah!

601
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:26,912
Everyone's raw.It's okay.

602
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:30,782
All right.I'm sorry.

603
00:05:32,349 --> 00:05:34,452
My bad.

604
00:05:37,633 --> 00:05:58,977
I'm not a huggy griever, Vic.

605
00:06:01,144 --> 00:06:01,146
Katja Obinger.

606
00:06:02,246 --> 00:06:07,719
Berlin.

607
00:06:10,387 --> 00:06:42,387
Who the hell are you?

608
00:06:44,507 --> 00:06:46,591
Eh. Oh, what timedo you open?

609
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:55,099
I need a front anddriver's-side window.

610
00:06:58,869 --> 00:06:58,871
Vic, I'm tired.

611
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:00,272
One last drink.

612
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:02,841
A bourbon for Sarah.

613
00:07:05,575 --> 00:07:10,996
Oh.Oh, Jesus.

614
00:07:12,752 --> 00:07:14,886
Very good.

615
00:07:15,886 --> 00:07:15,888
Okay.

616
00:07:17,587 --> 00:07:17,589
Off you go.

617
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:19,591
Wait a minute.My turn.

618
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,661
God!

619
00:07:25,395 --> 00:07:25,397
I want to get to knowSarah's daughter.

620
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:26,932
Out, Vic!

621
00:07:28,165 --> 00:07:28,167
Why not?!

622
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:29,668
There's a reasonyou never met her.

623
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:31,036
What is it?

624
00:07:32,402 --> 00:07:32,404
Well, let's see.

625
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:33,872
For starters,you're a drug dealer.

626
00:07:35,305 --> 00:07:35,307
I could help her financially.

627
00:07:37,107 --> 00:07:37,109
And Sarah left you.

628
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:40,612
She ran because you're abusive.

629
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:42,715
I want to make up for that.

630
00:07:44,081 --> 00:07:44,083
All right, let's go.

631
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:46,952
Let's go.

632
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:48,220
Felix,

633
00:07:50,087 --> 00:07:50,089
I want to stayconnected to her.

634
00:07:52,322 --> 00:07:52,324
To who?Who, Vic?!

635
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:55,294
Her.

636
00:07:59,129 --> 00:07:59,131
Vic, Kira is not Sarah.

637
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:01,066
Sarah's dead and she'snot coming back.

638
00:08:02,933 --> 00:08:04,802
You need to man upand accept that.

639
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:06,520
Felix?

640
00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:28,860
Hug me.

641
00:08:30,293 --> 00:08:32,364
Oh, come on.

642
00:08:34,498 --> 00:08:34,500
Vic!I have a knife

643
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:35,934
and I will stab youin the face!

644
00:08:38,668 --> 00:08:38,670
Shit.

645
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:40,606
Aren't you supposedto wait, like,

646
00:08:42,672 --> 00:08:42,674
three days before rising?

647
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:44,710
What the hell's this?

648
00:08:46,076 --> 00:08:46,078
That is your wake.

649
00:08:47,511 --> 00:08:47,513
It was agony.

650
00:08:50,313 --> 00:08:50,315
Yeah, Vic was here.Why'd you have one?

651
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:51,784
Because I was mad at you,

652
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:53,152
so I just decidedto blow all the money

653
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:56,455
from your stolen coke on it.

654
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:00,125
Felix! Does Kirathink I'm dead?

655
00:09:02,826 --> 00:09:02,828
I don't know.

656
00:09:04,828 --> 00:09:04,830
Oh, you don't know?

657
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:07,800
Vic screwed everything up

658
00:09:09,866 --> 00:09:09,868
when he got holdof Mrs. S., somehow.

659
00:09:11,501 --> 00:09:11,503
I don't knowwhat she told Kira.

660
00:09:14,438 --> 00:09:14,440
Vic.

661
00:09:16,073 --> 00:09:16,075
Yeah.Since you died,

662
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:17,976
he's even more obsessed.

663
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:19,711
He wants to meet Kira.

664
00:09:21,878 --> 00:09:21,880
No!

665
00:09:23,346 --> 00:09:23,348
No, I know that!

666
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:28,486
Of course not. You thinkwe'd let that happen?

667
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:29,988
Hey, what's that?

668
00:09:31,721 --> 00:09:31,723
Right there.Well, it looks like...

669
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:33,992
It looks like blood.

670
00:09:37,394 --> 00:09:37,396
Hey, whoa!What's going on?

671
00:09:40,964 --> 00:09:40,966
- Nothing.- Hey!

672
00:09:42,966 --> 00:09:42,968
Nothing. I don't wantto talk about it.

673
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,674
Sarah!

674
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:53,312
You remember thosebirth certificates, yeah?

675
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:54,680
Beth's and the two others?

676
00:09:57,047 --> 00:09:57,049
Yeah, Katja and Alison.

677
00:09:58,448 --> 00:09:58,450
- Yeah?- Yeah.

678
00:10:00,383 --> 00:10:00,385
Well, I met the German.

679
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:05,357
What? Is she...another twin?

680
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:07,860
Yeah.

681
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:10,028
- Leave it out, Felix.- Did she say who she was?

682
00:10:11,394 --> 00:10:11,396
- Don't.- What did she say?!

683
00:10:13,563 --> 00:10:13,565
I'm not gettinginto it. I can't...

684
00:10:16,066 --> 00:10:16,068
- I seriously cannot explain it.- All right, fine.

685
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:17,536
Stop.

686
00:10:19,402 --> 00:10:19,404
Look,

687
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:22,441
I need you to tell Mrs. S.I'm not dead, yeah?

688
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:23,876
That it was all a mistake.

689
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:26,712
No! No way.You do it.

690
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:28,881
If I walk in there now,after 10 months,

691
00:10:30,947 --> 00:10:30,949
think about how hardshe can make custody.

692
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:35,888
What, so I go inand I say what?

693
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:37,055
Lie?

694
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:39,591
My God.

695
00:10:41,191 --> 00:10:41,193
Tell her it wasn't me.I don't care.

696
00:10:43,693 --> 00:10:43,695
Just make sure Kiraknows that I'm fine.

697
00:10:45,128 --> 00:10:45,130
Yeah?

698
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:48,400
We can still get out with her.

699
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:52,871
That's my one bit of good news.

700
00:10:54,871 --> 00:10:54,873
Is this evil twin's money?

701
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:56,642
Yeah, $75,000 in cash.

702
00:10:58,141 --> 00:10:58,143
That's enough to lose Vic,

703
00:11:00,143 --> 00:11:00,145
lose the twin-sister weirdness,

704
00:11:01,878 --> 00:11:01,880
just somewhere safewith my daughter.

705
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:03,382
Is that so much to ask?

706
00:11:06,883 --> 00:11:06,885
Yeah, maybe.

707
00:11:08,785 --> 00:11:08,787
What?

708
00:11:10,987 --> 00:11:10,989
"Detective Arthur Bell".

709
00:11:12,689 --> 00:11:13,925
What?!

710
00:11:16,326 --> 00:11:16,328
Bastard must've followedme and nicked it.

711
00:11:17,961 --> 00:11:17,963
All right.

712
00:11:20,397 --> 00:11:20,399
All right, let's notgo off, though, okay?

713
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:22,100
No. Hey, let's...No, Sarah!

714
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:23,235
Agh!

715
00:11:25,135 --> 00:11:25,137
Sarah! Sarah!

716
00:11:26,169 --> 00:11:26,171
Aah!

717
00:11:27,971 --> 00:11:27,973
Bastard!

718
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:30,275
Bastard!

719
00:11:31,908 --> 00:11:31,910
Sarah! S...

720
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:34,780
Whoa, hey, no!Not that.

721
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:41,319
I'm working on that.

722
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:42,955
Maggie Chen.

723
00:11:44,521 --> 00:11:44,523
Who the hell is Maggie Chen?

724
00:11:46,723 --> 00:11:46,725
Uh, it's the woman Beth shot.

725
00:11:47,857 --> 00:11:47,859
Right.

726
00:11:49,926 --> 00:11:49,928
So, now, what arethese, all right?

727
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:51,129
Official statement.

728
00:11:54,197 --> 00:11:54,199
Detective Arthur Bell,official statement.

729
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:55,968
Detective Elizabeth Childs.

730
00:11:57,834 --> 00:11:57,836
What is this?

731
00:11:59,836 --> 00:11:59,838
This is... this is,like, the case.

732
00:12:02,372 --> 00:12:02,374
He left it for me.

733
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:04,543
Her.

734
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:06,645
If we want the moneyback from Art,

735
00:12:08,245 --> 00:12:08,247
I to have to be Beth again.

736
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:09,314
Oh, for Christ's sake.

737
00:12:11,281 --> 00:12:11,283
How long can you keepgaming a cop?

738
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:13,952
'Til I get our money.

739
00:12:15,852 --> 00:12:15,854
It's 6:00 in the morning.You're going to call him now?

740
00:12:18,688 --> 00:12:27,299
Yeah, believe me... thiscall, he's waiting for.

741
00:12:28,732 --> 00:12:28,734
Took you a while.

742
00:12:30,367 --> 00:12:30,369
What the hell are you doing?

743
00:12:32,302 --> 00:12:32,304
Hey, I'm just followingorders, Beth.

744
00:12:34,704 --> 00:12:34,706
Orders to steal from me?

745
00:12:36,306 --> 00:12:36,308
The lieutenant said "Takeyour rookie by the hand,

746
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,277
walk her right throughthe hearing."

747
00:12:42,594 --> 00:12:42,714
Did you stop to check it beforeyou crossed the border?

748
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:44,983
Art, I'm at home!You got it all wrong.

749
00:12:46,716 --> 00:12:46,718
I never get it all wrong, do I?

750
00:12:49,052 --> 00:12:49,054
Well, it's not what you think.

751
00:12:52,489 --> 00:12:52,491
Meet me at Fung's at noon.

752
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:57,262
Fung's?

753
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:05,094
What the hell's Fung's?

754
00:13:06,895 --> 00:13:10,266
Paul?

755
00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:11,701
Where were you last night?

756
00:13:13,201 --> 00:13:13,203
Aw, shit!

757
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:15,005
Don't do that!

758
00:13:17,071 --> 00:13:17,073
I... I, uh...

759
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:19,009
I was at the station,

760
00:13:22,043 --> 00:13:22,045
I was catching upon this backlog.

761
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:23,680
You're under suspension.

762
00:13:25,813 --> 00:13:25,815
Yeah, so?

763
00:13:28,716 --> 00:13:28,718
They reconvened the hearing.

764
00:13:30,418 --> 00:13:30,420
I have to get on topof this stuff.

765
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:31,922
First, you screw me wildfor the first time

766
00:13:34,055 --> 00:13:34,057
in months, and then,you don't even call me

767
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:35,892
to tell me that you'reout all night?

768
00:13:37,792 --> 00:13:37,794
And why are yousuddenly dressing

769
00:13:39,961 --> 00:13:39,963
like a punk-rock ho?

770
00:13:41,262 --> 00:13:41,264
Say again.

771
00:13:43,231 --> 00:13:43,233
No.

772
00:13:44,632 --> 00:13:44,634
You know what?Don't.

773
00:13:46,134 --> 00:13:46,136
I'm going to ignore that.

774
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:49,205
I'm worried you'relosing the plot again.

775
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:50,874
We've been here before.

776
00:13:52,073 --> 00:13:52,075
No, Paul,

777
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:54,878
we definitely haven'tbeen here before.

778
00:13:58,479 --> 00:13:58,481
Sorry. I've gota lot of work to do.

779
00:14:02,183 --> 00:14:02,185
If you want, I can take itto the station, yeah?

780
00:14:03,685 --> 00:14:03,687
Beth, you're notready for this.

781
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:05,221
You need to take more time.

782
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:06,890
Is that a diagnosis?Because I have plenty

783
00:14:08,523 --> 00:14:08,525
of professional help for that.

784
00:14:10,024 --> 00:14:12,027
- Babe, please...- Don't touch me.

785
00:14:13,461 --> 00:14:13,463
You know,

786
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:15,432
I can see this shootingis killing you,

787
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:17,901
but you stopped talkingto me months ago.

788
00:14:20,969 --> 00:14:20,971
Paul.

789
00:14:23,338 --> 00:14:23,340
What am I supposed to do?

790
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:24,741
It's my problem.

791
00:14:27,842 --> 00:14:27,844
You don't have to take this on.

792
00:14:29,143 --> 00:14:29,145
Well, I have.

793
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:32,182
And I can't keepwaking up every night,

794
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:35,452
checking your breathing,worried you're mixing

795
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:38,922
your meds, booze, Godknows what else, so...

796
00:14:40,488 --> 00:14:40,490
I'm going back to Cody'sfor a while.

797
00:14:42,957 --> 00:14:44,426
Okay.

798
00:14:47,695 --> 00:15:04,179
Yeah, if that's what you want.

799
00:15:05,546 --> 00:15:23,832
"Punk-rock ho"?

800
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:25,468
Oh.

801
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:27,637
Hi, monkey.

802
00:15:29,837 --> 00:15:29,839
Did you see my mum?

803
00:15:32,173 --> 00:15:33,575
Oh.Um, sweetie...

804
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:35,211
Oi-oi, Mrs. S.

805
00:15:38,346 --> 00:15:38,348
Go onupstairs, Kira, love.

806
00:15:41,616 --> 00:15:45,421
Uncle Felix has gotsome explaining to do.

807
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:47,824
I knew it wastoo good to be true.

808
00:15:51,793 --> 00:15:51,795
Sarah's too toughto commit suicide.

809
00:15:53,294 --> 00:15:54,897
Most feral muttI ever took in.

810
00:15:56,264 --> 00:15:56,266
Don't shrug.

811
00:15:58,499 --> 00:15:58,501
Staging a funeralto get away from Vic.

812
00:16:01,736 --> 00:16:01,738
Why would you help withsuch a stupid plan?

813
00:16:04,105 --> 00:16:04,107
Vic's a dick.

814
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:07,877
Plagued, that girl was,

815
00:16:09,377 --> 00:16:09,379
from the very start.

816
00:16:11,045 --> 00:16:11,047
What do you mean by that?

817
00:16:12,547 --> 00:16:12,549
Tell her

818
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:15,051
that she hasn't seen herdaughter in almost a year

819
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,153
and I think it's bestif it stays like that.

820
00:16:19,087 --> 00:16:19,089
Why don't you tell heryourself, Siobhan?

821
00:16:21,222 --> 00:16:21,342
I'm not going to playFelix in the middle.

822
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:23,727
Oh, no? You're here at herbeck and call, aren't you?

823
00:16:26,327 --> 00:16:26,329
Yes, I am! To make surethat Kira doesn't think

824
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:28,031
that her mother's dead.

825
00:16:31,566 --> 00:16:31,568
And, oh, good, look...she doesn't.

826
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:34,537
You and Sarah, youcan work out the rest.

827
00:16:36,104 --> 00:16:36,106
Years of my life.

828
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:38,541
Leaving London,all my people there,

829
00:16:40,475 --> 00:16:42,745
to bring the two of youhere for a fresh start.

830
00:16:44,746 --> 00:16:44,748
I'd do it all again, Felix.

831
00:16:46,814 --> 00:16:46,816
Every visit fromthe bloody police,

832
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:49,452
every missing-persons report,

833
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:53,056
every punch we threw,

834
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:56,726
because Kira is a gift.

835
00:16:58,926 --> 00:16:58,928
Sarah knows that.

836
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:04,567
No, she hasn't a clue.

837
00:17:07,602 --> 00:17:07,604
She is trying.

838
00:17:09,937 --> 00:17:09,939
Badly, granted,

839
00:17:12,507 --> 00:17:15,744
but in her own way, she is,she's really trying

840
00:17:17,612 --> 00:17:17,614
Ohh.

841
00:17:18,846 --> 00:17:18,848
Caught ya.

842
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:26,256
C'mere.C'mere, monkey.

843
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:28,992
When is mummy coming?

844
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:30,960
You know when, love.

845
00:17:33,961 --> 00:17:33,963
When she's ready?

846
00:17:35,963 --> 00:17:35,965
And?

847
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:38,835
When you say she's ready?

848
00:17:41,402 --> 00:17:52,781
Sounds fair to me.

849
00:17:54,048 --> 00:17:54,050
Right here

850
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:59,454
is where I thought I saw Yip.

851
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:00,957
That's when I drew my weapon.

852
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:02,392
She...

853
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:11,567
What'd she do?

854
00:18:14,569 --> 00:18:14,571
It's not a payoff,Art, it's not.

855
00:18:15,937 --> 00:18:15,939
Then cut the shit, Beth,

856
00:18:17,572 --> 00:18:17,574
and tell me where it came from.

857
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,042
It's Paul's, okay?

858
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:20,476
It's Paul's and mine.

859
00:18:23,244 --> 00:18:23,246
I cleaned out our jointsavings account.

860
00:18:25,746 --> 00:18:25,748
I haven't told him yet.

861
00:18:28,616 --> 00:18:28,618
Yeah, I was going toleave town,

862
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:31,154
but I couldn't do it,okay? I turned around.

863
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:33,656
For Paul.

864
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:36,159
To clear the shooting, Art.

865
00:18:41,095 --> 00:18:43,832
I'm not dirty,I just freaked out.

866
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:45,501
Are you wearing a wire?

867
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:47,503
No!

868
00:18:48,936 --> 00:18:48,938
You never saw the vic before?

869
00:18:50,771 --> 00:18:50,773
No previous contactwith Margaret Chen?

870
00:18:53,207 --> 00:18:53,209
No!

871
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:55,912
If there is anotherversion of the story,

872
00:18:58,112 --> 00:18:58,114
if that moneyis somehow connected.

873
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:03,619
There's only one story, Art.

874
00:19:05,253 --> 00:19:05,255
Then walk me through it again,

875
00:19:06,921 --> 00:19:06,923
so I know you won'tcrack under questioning.

876
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:10,860
I was by myself, I was

877
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:12,362
canvassing witnesseson another case.

878
00:19:13,427 --> 00:19:13,429
Which case?

879
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:16,366
The Ramsay thing.Sun Jewelry heist.

880
00:19:18,432 --> 00:19:18,434
The Ramsay thing.

881
00:19:20,334 --> 00:19:20,336
Sun Jewelry heist.

882
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:21,571
I wasn't even looking for Yip.

883
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:22,972
Yip who?

884
00:19:24,906 --> 00:19:24,908
Xan Yip, U.S. racketeeringwarrant. I'd seen

885
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:27,710
her sheet that morning...Asian female, 41.

886
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:31,980
And?

887
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:32,982
And...

888
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:34,717
Right here...

889
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:36,886
Is where I thought I saw Yip.

890
00:19:38,252 --> 00:19:38,254
You thought?

891
00:19:39,787 --> 00:19:39,789
I did.I saw her.

892
00:19:41,989 --> 00:19:41,991
I called her name,I told her to freeze.

893
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:43,793
She didn't.She ran.

894
00:19:47,161 --> 00:19:47,163
Disappeared down...

895
00:19:48,763 --> 00:19:48,765
You're making me nervous.

896
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:49,832
Good.

897
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:52,802
Now, you know how it feels.

898
00:19:54,302 --> 00:19:54,304
When did you draw your weapon?

899
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:57,407
I drew when I enteredthe courtyard, here.

900
00:19:58,739 --> 00:19:58,741
That's when I drew my weapon.

901
00:20:00,107 --> 00:20:00,109
And then she disappeareddown there.

902
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:02,245
I crossed to there.

903
00:20:04,612 --> 00:20:04,614
And that's when I heardsomebody behind me

904
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:05,782
and I turned around...

905
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:07,417
Poogh!And I fired

906
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:25,133
twice.

907
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:27,603
They were both wearing black.

908
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:28,972
It wasn't her.

909
00:20:31,005 --> 00:20:31,007
It wasn't her.

910
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:34,777
Then what?

911
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:36,279
Then I saw the phonein her hand

912
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:39,615
and I called it in.

913
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:41,617
And then you showed up.

914
00:20:44,275 --> 00:20:44,395
If they find outyou called me

915
00:20:46,721 --> 00:20:46,723
before you called it in,Beth,

916
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:48,257
they're going to start to dig.

917
00:20:49,757 --> 00:20:49,759
And if they dig,they find the pills

918
00:20:51,225 --> 00:20:51,227
and, if they find the pills,

919
00:20:52,727 --> 00:20:52,729
you may crack under questioning

920
00:20:54,261 --> 00:20:54,263
and tell themthat I put the phone

921
00:20:56,397 --> 00:21:00,469
in the vic's hand tocover your tweaker ass.

922
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:04,307
I wouldn't do that, Art.

923
00:21:07,908 --> 00:21:07,910
I got to carry what I did.

924
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:10,813
Maggie Chen was

925
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:13,983
in the wrong placeat the wrong time.

926
00:21:17,585 --> 00:21:17,587
That's it.

927
00:21:20,021 --> 00:21:20,023
None of this ends up on you.

928
00:21:23,124 --> 00:21:23,126
Good.

929
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:25,661
But, to be sure,

930
00:21:27,128 --> 00:21:27,130
I'm going to hang onto that money

931
00:21:28,596 --> 00:21:28,598
until you're cleared.

932
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:44,517
How's that?

933
00:21:46,149 --> 00:21:46,269
Kira's fine.

934
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:47,859
You're not deadto your daughter.

935
00:21:50,422 --> 00:21:51,525
C'mere.

936
00:21:53,755 --> 00:21:53,875
I know. I know.

937
00:21:55,493 --> 00:21:55,613
She knows I'm back,doesn't she?

938
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,000
I can feel her.

939
00:21:59,164 --> 00:21:59,166
She knows. She's beenasking for you.

940
00:22:00,665 --> 00:22:00,667
She knows.I know.

941
00:22:02,367 --> 00:22:02,369
Okay.What about Mrs. S.?

942
00:22:03,868 --> 00:22:03,870
Don't worry aboutthat now, okay?

943
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:05,372
We'll work it out later.

944
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:06,645
Thank you.

945
00:22:09,241 --> 00:22:09,243
Just take us with youwhen you leave again.

946
00:22:11,443 --> 00:22:11,445
I promise, I promise,I promise.

947
00:22:13,412 --> 00:22:13,414
All right.Do you want a cuppa?

948
00:22:15,187 --> 00:22:15,307
Yeah.

949
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:18,252
So Art won'tgive me the money

950
00:22:19,751 --> 00:22:19,753
until I clear Beth's shooting.

951
00:22:21,253 --> 00:22:21,255
What do you mean,like, go back

952
00:22:22,821 --> 00:22:22,823
in front of a police board,

953
00:22:24,189 --> 00:22:24,191
with, like, lawyersand cross-examination,

954
00:22:25,657 --> 00:22:28,495
- and stuff?- Yeah.

955
00:22:30,362 --> 00:22:32,466
That's the least of my worries.

956
00:22:33,865 --> 00:22:35,903
That's Beth's other phone.

957
00:22:37,002 --> 00:22:37,004
Is that the German?

958
00:22:38,537 --> 00:22:38,539
It's definitely not the German.

959
00:22:40,639 --> 00:22:40,641
All right, I think it's time

960
00:22:43,308 --> 00:22:43,310
that you told me what'sactually going on.

961
00:22:45,177 --> 00:22:45,179
Beth was investigatingher twins, too.

962
00:22:46,578 --> 00:22:46,580
I think whatever shefound out drove her nuts

963
00:22:48,814 --> 00:22:48,816
and she topped herself.

964
00:22:50,415 --> 00:22:50,417
What?

965
00:22:52,384 --> 00:22:52,386
So do I pick up?No!

966
00:22:54,252 --> 00:22:54,254
No!

967
00:22:55,687 --> 00:22:55,689
I can't help myself.

968
00:22:56,922 --> 00:22:56,924
Then why even ask?

969
00:22:59,024 --> 00:22:59,026
Shh.

970
00:23:02,327 --> 00:23:02,329
Hello, uh, this is,um, this is Beth.

971
00:23:03,895 --> 00:23:03,897
Finally!Where have you been?

972
00:23:06,231 --> 00:23:06,233
Busy, obviously.

973
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:07,835
Right. Did you getthe German's briefcase?

974
00:23:09,234 --> 00:23:09,236
No. Why?

975
00:23:11,636 --> 00:23:11,638
Because I told you to.

976
00:23:13,438 --> 00:23:16,532
Where is she staying, Beth?

977
00:23:17,428 --> 00:23:17,548
Hello.

978
00:23:18,556 --> 00:23:20,914
One sec!

979
00:23:22,614 --> 00:23:22,616
Okay.

980
00:23:24,049 --> 00:23:24,051
Uh,

981
00:23:26,485 --> 00:23:26,487
Carlsborough Hotel, room 303.

982
00:23:27,652 --> 00:23:27,654
Well, go,

983
00:23:29,354 --> 00:23:29,356
get the briefcasebefore they do.

984
00:23:32,257 --> 00:23:32,259
I'll call backat midnight.

985
00:23:34,126 --> 00:23:34,128
What's in...

986
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:35,562
What's in the briefcase?

987
00:23:37,262 --> 00:23:37,264
Who is that?

988
00:23:39,831 --> 00:23:39,833
Every time I thinkI know something,

989
00:23:40,966 --> 00:23:40,968
I'm wrong.

990
00:23:42,701 --> 00:23:44,103
Whoa, hold on.

991
00:23:45,771 --> 00:23:45,773
Beth,

992
00:23:47,305 --> 00:23:47,307
Katja,

993
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:48,942
and Alison Hendrix.

994
00:23:50,108 --> 00:23:50,110
Is it her?

995
00:23:52,144 --> 00:23:52,146
I don't know, Felix.

996
00:23:54,746 --> 00:23:54,748
Well, what happenedto the German?

997
00:23:56,248 --> 00:23:56,250
Are you seriously going there?

998
00:23:57,783 --> 00:23:57,785
Don't you want to knowwhat's in the briefcase?

999
00:23:59,117 --> 00:23:59,119
No!

1000
00:24:01,286 --> 00:24:01,288
Cash?

1001
00:24:03,622 --> 00:24:03,624
It's still a hustle, Fe.

1002
00:24:06,224 --> 00:24:06,226
Can I borrow this?

1003
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:08,662
No. Yeah.I don't know.

1004
00:24:10,395 --> 00:24:10,397
Mmm.

1005
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:11,432
Guten morgen.

1006
00:24:13,632 --> 00:24:13,634

Don't worry.

1009
00:24:17,836 --> 00:24:17,838
You actually lookkind of hot.

1010
00:24:19,805 --> 00:24:23,811
It's good, innit?

1011
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:38,224
Nein, nein.

1012
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:40,561
Miss Obinger.

1013
00:24:43,995 --> 00:24:43,997
Miss Obinger?

1014
00:24:46,331 --> 00:24:46,333
Miss Obinger!

1015
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:53,206

1016
00:24:55,307 --> 00:24:58,245
- Was that her?- Yeah.

1017
00:24:59,478 --> 00:26:02,509
♪ Yeah

1018
00:26:03,508 --> 00:26:23,730
Shit.

1019
00:26:24,729 --> 00:26:34,740
Shit.

1020
00:26:37,642 --> 00:26:37,644
Ahem. Ja.

1021
00:26:40,445 --> 00:26:40,447
Hello. Avery,from the front desk.

1022
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,450
Could we talk with youdownstairs, please?

1023
00:26:46,618 --> 00:26:46,620
Why would you go in my room?

1024
00:26:48,153 --> 00:26:48,155
We had a noise complaint,

1025
00:26:49,955 --> 00:26:49,957
which led to a security check.

1026
00:26:51,957 --> 00:26:51,959
Ma'am, your room was trashed.

1027
00:26:54,092 --> 00:26:54,094
Rock-n-roll.

1028
00:26:56,061 --> 00:26:56,063
"Rock-n-roll"?

1029
00:26:57,562 --> 00:26:57,564
The sink is broken.

1030
00:26:59,931 --> 00:26:59,933
What the heckis wrong with you?

1031
00:27:01,266 --> 00:27:01,268
Unfortunately, we havean itemized bill.

1032
00:27:03,301 --> 00:27:03,303
Sink, mirror,

00:27:05,503 --> 00:27:05,505

00:27:11,309 --> 00:27:11,311
$6,437.11, yes.

1036
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:17,817
Ja.

So? You have my cardon file, ja?

1038
00:27:22,053 --> 00:27:23,956
Yes.

1039
00:27:26,024 --> 00:27:29,962
And my briefcase.

1040
00:27:32,063 --> 00:27:36,969
One moment.

1041
00:27:40,405 --> 00:27:48,314
Authorizing.

1042
00:27:50,315 --> 00:27:57,590
Must've been a heck of a party.

1043
00:28:00,992 --> 00:28:00,994
Everything appearsto be in order.

1044
00:28:03,128 --> 00:28:03,130
I'm very sorry about this.

1045
00:28:04,362 --> 00:28:04,364
Ahem!

1046
00:28:06,431 --> 00:28:06,433
Are you enjoying the city?

1047
00:28:07,766 --> 00:28:07,768
It's killing me.

1048
00:28:10,435 --> 00:29:02,621

You're practically local.

1057
00:29:51,569 --> 00:29:56,375
And punctual.

1058
00:29:57,409 --> 00:29:57,411
Hello?

1059

Hey. Did you getto the hotel?

1060
00:30:03,681 --> 00:30:03,683
Yeah, but somebodygot there first.

1061
00:30:06,851 --> 00:30:06,853
They ransacked her room.

1062
00:30:09,587 --> 00:30:09,589
- Shit!- No briefcase?

1063
00:30:11,437 --> 00:30:11,557
I didn't say that.

1064
00:30:13,489 --> 00:30:14,194
Did you find it, or not?

1065
00:30:15,693 --> 00:30:20,099
Hang on.

1066
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:22,502
Screw it.

Hello?Who am I speaking to?

1070
00:30:31,209 --> 00:30:31,211
Who is this?

1071
00:30:33,111 --> 00:30:33,113
Who is this?!

1072
00:30:37,048 --> 00:30:37,050

Yeah, sorry, riddler,means nothing to me.

1076
00:30:48,593 --> 00:30:48,595
Look, Beth said to sayI have the briefcase.

1077
00:30:50,094 --> 00:31:09,348
Do you want meto bring it to you?

1078
00:31:11,416 --> 00:32:31,597

1079
00:32:33,331 --> 00:32:33,333
Stop it!

1080
00:32:35,066 --> 00:32:35,068
You stop it!

1081
00:32:37,735 --> 00:32:37,737

Holy shite.

A soccer mom.

00:32:54,301 --> 00:32:54,303
Follow your sister.Don't run.

1087
00:32:56,403 --> 00:32:56,405
Good boy!

1088
00:32:57,571 --> 00:33:01,809
Good boy.

1089
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:04,914
There you go.

1090
00:33:07,181 --> 00:33:07,183
Over there!

1091
00:33:10,117 --> 00:33:10,119
Hello?

1092
00:33:11,718 --> 00:33:15,375
Oh.

1093
00:33:17,224 --> 00:33:19,408
Go. Go, go!

1094

Vivien! I'm going tocut the... yeah.

1095
00:34:23,222 --> 00:34:23,224
I just want some answers.

1096
00:34:25,725 --> 00:34:25,727
Are you out of your mind?

1097
00:34:27,493 --> 00:34:27,495
How dare you show your face

1098
00:34:28,828 --> 00:34:28,830
in front of my children.

1099
00:34:30,496 --> 00:34:30,498
How did you find me?

1100
00:34:32,331 --> 00:34:32,333
The German had your address.

1101
00:34:33,733 --> 00:34:33,735
I've got what you wanted.

1102
00:34:35,368 --> 00:34:37,205
I've got her briefcase.

1103
00:34:40,539 --> 00:34:40,541
Idiot. Do you even knowwho you're talking to?

1104
00:34:41,707 --> 00:34:41,709
Hmm?

1105
00:34:43,876 --> 00:34:43,878
Where is Beth?

1106
00:34:45,945 --> 00:34:48,081
Uh, she's dead.

1107
00:34:50,082 --> 00:34:50,084
What?

1108
00:34:53,185 --> 00:34:53,187
I'm sorry.She killed herself.

1109
00:34:56,422 --> 00:34:56,424
No. No, no, shewouldn't do that.

1110
00:34:57,556 --> 00:34:57,558
That's impossible.

1111
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:01,362
No, I'm sorry.I saw her do it.

1112
00:35:02,862 --> 00:35:02,864
No, that can't be.Mnh-mnh.

1113
00:35:04,563 --> 00:35:04,565
Look, I can explain, okay?

1114
00:35:05,931 --> 00:35:05,933
My name's Sarah...

1115
00:35:08,734 --> 00:35:08,736
I don't care who you are.

1116
00:35:11,537 --> 00:35:11,539
Why, Lord?Why me?

1117
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:13,041
I never wantedany part of this.

1118
00:35:14,307 --> 00:35:14,309
Do I wear a huge"kick me" sign

1119
00:35:15,675 --> 00:35:15,677
on my back?

1120
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:17,378
Please, just tell me...

1121
00:35:18,911 --> 00:35:18,913
Who are we to each other?

1122
00:35:22,915 --> 00:35:22,917
Are you kidding me?

1123
00:35:24,483 --> 00:35:24,485
I'm not doing that.

1124
00:35:26,352 --> 00:35:26,354
Nope, that is notmy responsibility...

1125
00:35:31,724 --> 00:35:31,726
You know, you needto get out of here.

1126
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:34,262
Go and wait for a call.

1127
00:35:35,561 --> 00:35:35,563
Eh, tell me what the hell...

1128
00:35:38,731 --> 00:35:38,733
Let go!Don't touch me.

1129
00:35:40,566 --> 00:35:40,568
This is my neighborhood.

1130
00:35:43,469 --> 00:35:44,638
You wait for a call.

1131
00:35:46,305 --> 00:35:46,307
Oh, and hide your ugly face

1132
00:35:48,708 --> 00:35:50,477
on the way out of here.

1133
00:35:51,977 --> 00:35:51,979
Bitch.

1134
00:35:54,814 --> 00:36:04,257
Okay, oranges, guys!

1135
00:36:05,658 --> 00:36:05,660
Can I take two?

1136
00:36:08,461 --> 00:36:17,739
Yeah, you take two.

1137
00:36:19,171 --> 00:36:19,173
What's up, Art?

1138
00:36:21,273 --> 00:36:21,275
Where are you?

1139
00:36:22,742 --> 00:36:22,744
I'm at home in the tubwith a bourbon.

1140
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:24,112
Can you hear me knocking?

1141
00:36:25,511 --> 00:36:25,513
No?

1142
00:36:27,146 --> 00:36:27,148
Because you're not home.

1143
00:36:28,647 --> 00:36:28,649
Okay, I'm in Scarborough.

1144
00:36:30,683 --> 00:36:30,685
What? Why?!

1145
00:36:32,618 --> 00:36:32,620
I had to go to BedBath & Beyond, okay?

1146
00:36:34,019 --> 00:36:34,021
Nobody wants to admit that.

1147
00:36:36,021 --> 00:36:36,023
Look, whatever, Beth.

1148
00:36:37,757 --> 00:36:37,759
What the hell did yousay to the shrink?

1149
00:36:39,492 --> 00:36:39,494
She's ruling youunfit for duty.

1150
00:36:40,659 --> 00:36:40,661
What? Why?

1151
00:36:43,929 --> 00:36:43,931
Yeah, unfit meansno hearing tomorrow.

1152
00:36:45,297 --> 00:36:45,299
Oh, shit!

1153
00:36:47,299 --> 00:36:47,301
It means this crap goes onand on and guess what...

1154
00:36:49,769 --> 00:36:49,771
I'm keeping your moneyuntil it ends.

1155
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:51,272
I'll go see her now.

1156
00:36:52,705 --> 00:36:52,707
No no no, it's too latefor that, Beth.

1157
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:54,342
Get me anotherappointment, okay?

1158
00:36:57,376 --> 00:36:57,378
Tell her it's an emergency,you're worried about me.

1159
00:36:59,678 --> 00:36:59,680
She's my doctor.She has to see me.

1160
00:37:01,614 --> 00:37:01,616
And what are you going to sayto her to change her mind?

1161
00:37:04,316 --> 00:37:04,318
I'll figure something out.

1162
00:37:06,118 --> 00:37:06,120
I'm sorry.

1163
00:37:09,155 --> 00:37:09,157
My opinion is you'renot ready for duty.

1164
00:37:10,823 --> 00:37:10,825
I am, though.

1165
00:37:12,825 --> 00:37:12,827
I'm making progress,full progress.

1166
00:37:15,027 --> 00:37:15,029
Go on.

1167
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:18,232
You know, with the guilt,

1168
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:20,601
seeing cell phoneand reacting "gun".

1169
00:37:22,935 --> 00:37:22,937
You're just parroting ourlast meeting back to me.

1170
00:37:25,004 --> 00:37:25,006
No, I'm admitting my mistake,

1171
00:37:26,872 --> 00:37:26,874
Dr. Bowers,

1172
00:37:30,109 --> 00:37:30,111
I'm acknowledging it,like you said.

1173
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:31,600
Honestly, the bestthing for me now is

1174
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:32,580
to get back to work.

1175
00:37:34,254 --> 00:37:34,374
Last time I saw you,you couldn't remember

1176
00:37:37,283 --> 00:37:37,285
the shooting."I'm missing myself.

1177
00:37:39,285 --> 00:37:39,287
I glitched.

1178
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:41,022
A break,or something."

1179
00:37:43,722 --> 00:37:43,724
I remember it just fine.

1180
00:37:45,324 --> 00:37:45,326
What I'm tryingto do is move on.

1181
00:37:46,792 --> 00:37:46,794
Sorry, Beth, but, considering

1182
00:37:48,461 --> 00:37:48,463
your mental state, leadingup to the incident...

1183
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:50,832
That's behind me now,Dr. Bowers.

1184
00:37:53,065 --> 00:37:53,067
And by your own admission ofblackout or psychotic break,

1185
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,938
I can't recommend you for duty.

1186
00:37:58,737 --> 00:37:58,739
That's not going towork for me.

1187
00:38:01,507 --> 00:38:01,509
I understand, you're a cop,

1188
00:38:03,509 --> 00:38:05,879
but this is my job.

1189
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:07,582
Can you read that back again?

1190
00:38:09,181 --> 00:38:09,183
That, um,

1191
00:38:12,017 --> 00:38:14,321
"I'm missing myself.I glitched."

1192
00:38:15,821 --> 00:38:15,823
Does that sound stoned to you?

1193
00:38:19,058 --> 00:38:19,060
"Glitched" sounds stoned?

1194
00:38:23,362 --> 00:38:23,364
Tweaked, gakked, spun.

1195
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:25,132
Ahem!Allevia,

1196
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:28,102
superprax, draxifil.

1197
00:38:29,902 --> 00:38:29,904
What's the differencebetween a mood stabilizer

1198
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:31,272
and an antipsychotic, again?

1199
00:38:33,172 --> 00:38:33,174
Beth...

1200
00:38:34,607 --> 00:38:34,609
Oh, no, I'm sorry,I've been confused.

1201
00:38:36,008 --> 00:38:36,010
I mean, it's very confusing.

1202
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:37,512
Um...

1203
00:38:41,347 --> 00:38:41,349
Antidepressants,antianxieties, SSRIs.

1204
00:38:43,415 --> 00:38:43,417
Serotronax...That one's a stimulant.

1205
00:38:45,684 --> 00:38:45,686
We have known each otherfor a while, now, Beth...

1206
00:38:46,959 --> 00:38:47,079
Yeah? That's whereyou're wrong.

1207
00:38:48,439 --> 00:38:48,559
You have constantlytested me

1208
00:38:50,689 --> 00:38:50,691
with your personal appealsfor prescriptions.

1209
00:38:52,558 --> 00:38:52,560
I know.

1210
00:38:55,294 --> 00:38:55,296
My bad.

1211
00:38:56,929 --> 00:38:56,931
So I'll just explainto the board

1212
00:38:58,797 --> 00:38:58,799
that I shot this poorcivilian after mixing up

1213
00:39:00,332 --> 00:39:03,639
all your overlapping scrips.

1214
00:39:08,107 --> 00:39:11,177
Or am I making progress?

1215
00:39:13,178 --> 00:39:13,180
All right, if everybody here,

1216
00:39:15,347 --> 00:39:15,349
let's see if wecould do this again.

1217
00:39:17,116 --> 00:39:17,118
The board convenes in a fatal

1218
00:39:20,753 --> 00:39:20,755
line-of-duty shooting,October 7th of this year.

1219
00:39:24,423 --> 00:39:24,425
State your name and rankfor the record

1220
00:39:28,494 --> 00:39:28,496
and begin.

1221
00:39:30,229 --> 00:39:35,447
Detective Elizabeth Childs.

1222
00:39:36,554 --> 00:39:36,674
You did well.

1223
00:39:38,255 --> 00:39:38,375
We'll have a rulingin a couple of days.

1224
00:39:39,476 --> 00:39:44,424
Okay.

1225
00:39:46,991 --> 00:39:46,993
This is Sarah.

1226
00:39:49,294 --> 00:39:49,296
Well, Sarah,this will be quick.

1227
00:39:50,461 --> 00:39:50,463
Good.

1228
00:39:53,298 --> 00:39:53,300
Since you apparentlyalready know where I live

1229
00:39:54,332 --> 00:39:54,334
and I can't find a sitter,

1230
00:39:56,367 --> 00:39:56,369
come by after 9:00tonight.

1231
00:39:57,869 --> 00:39:57,871
How about right now?

1232
00:39:59,771 --> 00:39:59,773
Tonight! Bring whateveryou got from the German.

1233
00:40:02,106 --> 00:40:02,108
Go around back and goto the basement door.

1234
00:40:04,409 --> 00:40:04,411
Knock quietly!

1235
00:40:06,811 --> 00:40:08,113
Not bad, Childs.

1236
00:40:09,514 --> 00:40:15,721
Not bad.

1237
00:40:18,289 --> 00:40:18,291
I nailed it, man,

1238
00:40:19,357 --> 00:40:19,359
every detail.

1239
00:40:20,858 --> 00:40:20,860
Yeah. They haven'truled yet.

1240
00:40:22,794 --> 00:40:22,796
Please contain your excitement.

1241
00:40:24,095 --> 00:40:24,097
This is me, excited.

1242
00:40:25,463 --> 00:40:25,465
Come on, Art,

1243
00:40:28,299 --> 00:40:28,301
give me a littlelove, here, yeah?

1244
00:40:30,034 --> 00:40:30,036
Why do you have to besuch a hardass?

1245
00:40:31,135 --> 00:40:31,137
Because

1246
00:40:32,937 --> 00:40:36,343
it's your favoritething about me.

1247
00:40:37,942 --> 00:40:37,944
Look, Paul doesn't know

1248
00:40:39,744 --> 00:40:39,746
I took that moneyout of our account.

1249
00:40:42,447 --> 00:40:42,449
So just let me put it back

1250
00:40:43,915 --> 00:40:43,917
before he finds out, yeah?

1251
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:45,952
I hang on to it 'tilyou're reinstated.

1252
00:40:47,385 --> 00:40:47,387
That's the deal.

1253
00:40:49,887 --> 00:40:49,889
There was no deal,it was just you, taking...

1254
00:40:51,723 --> 00:40:51,725
Looking out for you,

1255
00:40:53,925 --> 00:41:00,232
partner.

1256
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:02,602
Oh, my God!Ugh!

1257
00:41:04,102 --> 00:41:04,104
You know I neverwould've got in

1258
00:41:07,171 --> 00:41:07,173
if you said we weregoing to suburbia.

1259
00:41:09,073 --> 00:41:09,075
Oi, what are you doing?

1260
00:41:11,109 --> 00:41:11,111
Don't stop. Someonemight speak to us.

1261
00:41:12,643 --> 00:41:12,645
God!

1262
00:41:14,979 --> 00:41:14,981
Christ.

1263
00:41:16,814 --> 00:41:16,816
You know, my skinjust breaks out

1264
00:41:18,649 --> 00:41:18,651
every time I leavethe downtown.

1265
00:41:20,752 --> 00:41:20,754
Yeah, yeah.

1266
00:41:22,253 --> 00:41:22,255
Right there.Look... acne.

1267
00:41:23,921 --> 00:41:23,923
No,

1268
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:25,792
I don't see acne.

1269
00:41:28,092 --> 00:41:28,094
Am I blushing?

1270
00:41:29,494 --> 00:41:29,496
There's redness!Right there!

1271
00:41:32,096 --> 00:41:32,098
Tiny, little suburbanstress zits, emerging

1272
00:41:33,731 --> 00:41:33,733
in direct proximityto bad architecture.

1273
00:41:34,966 --> 00:41:34,968
Look, Fe,

1274
00:41:37,835 --> 00:41:37,837
I'm going to have themoney in a couple days.

1275
00:41:39,437 --> 00:41:39,439
Okay? And then...Look,

1276
00:41:41,172 --> 00:41:41,174
I'll make good with Mrs. S.

1277
00:41:44,675 --> 00:41:44,677
and we'll take Kirasomewhere quiet, yeah?

1278
00:41:45,777 --> 00:41:45,779
Somewhere warm.

1279
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:49,682
Yeah, please.

1280
00:41:52,216 --> 00:41:52,218
So what's in the house?

1281
00:41:53,651 --> 00:41:53,653
I won't be long.

1282
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:55,622
Oh, my God!Who's in there?

1283
00:41:57,455 --> 00:41:57,457
Stay here, okay?

1284
00:41:58,623 --> 00:42:00,193
Is it the German?

1285
00:42:01,726 --> 00:42:01,728
The German's dead.

1286
00:42:03,494 --> 00:42:03,496
She's dead?!She died?!

1287
00:42:05,663 --> 00:42:05,665
Sadly, yes.

1288
00:42:07,398 --> 00:42:07,400
This one's an uptight

1289
00:42:08,733 --> 00:42:08,735
Soccer mom.

1290
00:42:10,835 --> 00:42:10,837
Hey, Sarah! You alwaysdo this to me!

1291
00:42:13,137 --> 00:42:13,139
I just need you to bemy backup, okay?

1292
00:42:15,139 --> 00:42:15,141
I don't do backup!

1293
00:42:17,041 --> 00:42:17,043
I don't even knowwhat backup is!

1294
00:42:18,342 --> 00:42:18,344
Give me half an hour.

1295
00:42:19,977 --> 00:42:19,979
What am I supposedto do 'til then?

1296
00:42:21,212 --> 00:42:21,214
Nothing.

1297
00:42:23,548 --> 00:42:23,550
I just need somebodyto know where I am.

1298
00:42:26,084 --> 00:42:26,086
Wait, that is notcomforting! Sarah!

1299
00:42:27,585 --> 00:42:52,344
Sh...!

1300
00:42:53,778 --> 00:43:01,186
Close it, lock it.

1301
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:02,322
Really?

1302
00:43:04,589 --> 00:43:04,591
Be quiet. My kidsare sleeping.

1303
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:05,992
You're going to shoot me

1304
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:07,393
while your kids are sleeping?

1305
00:43:09,093 --> 00:43:09,095
You wake them or show yourface, yes, I will shoot you.

1306
00:43:11,062 --> 00:43:11,064
Well I've never knowna blood relation,

1307
00:43:12,897 --> 00:43:12,899
but being your twincertainly sucks.

1308
00:43:14,232 --> 00:43:18,237
You really haveno idea, do you?

1309
00:43:19,337 --> 00:43:19,339
Hey.

1310
00:43:21,205 --> 00:43:21,207
I'm Cosima.

1311
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:22,442
Bloody hell.

1312
00:43:24,142 --> 00:43:24,144
We talked on the phone.

1313
00:43:27,712 --> 00:43:32,581
How many of us are there?

1314
00:43:34,782 --> 00:43:34,784
We're clones. We'resoneone's experiment

1315
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:35,852
and they're killing us off!

1316
00:43:37,184 --> 00:43:37,186
Is that helpful?

1317
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:39,122
Oh, my God! What areyou doing in my yard?

1318
00:43:41,389 --> 00:43:41,391
You want answers,I want the briefcase.

1319
00:43:43,024 --> 00:43:43,026
Seriously, life or death.

1320
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:44,460
What kind of mother am I

1321
00:43:46,661 --> 00:43:46,663
if I snatch my own daughter?

1322
00:43:48,362 --> 00:43:48,364
You're reinstated.

1323
00:43:50,364 --> 00:43:50,366
Oh, shit!

1324
00:43:51,799 --> 00:43:51,801
Yes, I'm at thebloody crime scene,

1325
00:43:53,334 --> 00:43:53,336
pretending to be a bloody cop,

1326
00:43:54,669 --> 00:43:54,671
so I need to know if thebloody fingerprints

1327
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:58,407
will flag a bloody match.

1328
00:43:59,674 --> 00:43:59,676
Freeze! Police!
