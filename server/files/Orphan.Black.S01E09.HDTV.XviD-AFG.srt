무슨 거짓말요?

175
00:08:54,821 --> 00:08:58,573
누군가 클럽 신진화에보안기록을 손댔었더군

176
00:08:58,575 --> 00:09:01,877
헌데, 그날밤 그곳에두명의 복제인간이

177
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:04,346
있었단걸 안다네아닌가?

178
00:09:07,183 --> 00:09:08,969
수년째 잃어버린복제인간을 찾고 있었다네

179
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,517
헬레나, 그애지

180
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:12,819
나의 흰고래라네폴!

181
00:09:12,821 --> 00:09:14,421
근데 들짐승같지

182
00:09:14,423 --> 00:09:16,123
그애가 자넬속일 리가 없지

183
00:09:16,614 --> 00:09:18,559
베스 흉내를 내다니

184
00:09:18,561 --> 00:09:20,560
여기 지붕 아래서

185
00:09:20,562 --> 00:09:22,257
저 침대에서?

186
00:09:24,767 --> 00:09:27,234
근데, 사라 매닝은가능하지

187
00:10:09,332 --> 00:10:11,211
젠장 뭐야?!

188
00:10:11,213 --> 00:10:13,247
짧게 "고마워"면충분해

189
00:10:13,249 --> 00:10:15,216
그래, 카이라는괜찮아지겠어?

190
00:10:15,218 --> 00:10:16,912
그래, 기적적으로회복했어

191
00:10:16,913 --> 00:10:18,012
잘됐네

192
00:10:18,811 --> 00:10:20,721
어, 어디에, 음..

193
00:10:20,723 --> 00:10:22,123
아, 네..

194
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:25,594
약이랑 관련된 것들은서랍에 있어

195
00:10:25,596 --> 00:10:28,464
그렇단건 약하는 것들이네 침대 옆에 있었단거지

196
00:10:28,466 --> 00:10:30,566
너 저것도닦았은거야?

197
00:10:30,568 --> 00:10:33,669
지금 우리 애들은엄마집에 있거든

198
00:10:33,671 --> 00:10:35,171
내가 애들한텐위험하니까

199
00:10:35,173 --> 00:10:38,006
그래서 이 집을

200
00:10:38,008 --> 00:10:41,010
나 아파트 찾는 동안

201
00:10:41,012 --> 00:10:42,411
기지로 쓸 수 있을까생각했거든

202
00:10:42,413 --> 00:10:43,479
안되거든!

203
00:10:43,481 --> 00:10:44,980
머, 도니가몇시간 동안은

204
00:10:44,982 --> 00:10:46,481
집을 비워놓고있을테니

205
00:10:46,483 --> 00:10:48,884
난 들려서

206
00:10:48,886 --> 00:10:51,239
옷이랑 잡다한 것들좀 가져와야겠어

207
00:10:52,788 --> 00:10:55,991
좋아!하룻밤만 지내도록해

208
00:10:55,993 --> 00:10:58,733
들어올때 나깨우지만 말아줘

209
00:11:03,054 --> 00:11:04,430
필릭스

210
00:11:05,372 --> 00:11:06,666
필릭스

211
00:11:06,871 --> 00:11:08,604
나 버림받았거든

212
00:11:08,606 --> 00:11:10,419
혼자서는돌아가지 못하겠어

213
00:11:12,477 --> 00:11:14,144
네가 지원사격 좀해주면 좋겠는데

214
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,960
빌어먹을너 진짜 이럴레?

215
00:11:21,888 --> 00:11:23,347

216
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:28,325
옷 좀갈아입어야겠다

217
00:11:28,327 --> 00:11:30,027
게이스러운 것좀 건네줘

218
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:32,896
세상에 젠장사라

219
00:11:32,898 --> 00:11:34,397
진짜 다행이다

220
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,667
그래, 의사들도까무러칠뻔했지

221
00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:39,069
니 생각엔 말야키아라가 내 아이라서

222
00:11:39,071 --> 00:11:41,205
특이할 수도있을거 같에?

223
00:11:41,207 --> 00:11:42,673
애한테 상처가없다고 그러는거야?

224
00:11:42,675 --> 00:11:44,108
그래그냥 물어보는 거야

225
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:47,444
머, 우리가 유전적으로조작된 거라면야

226
00:11:47,446 --> 00:11:49,479
그러니까, 니가 애한테뭔가를 물려줬을 수도 있지

227
00:11:49,481 --> 00:11:50,681
예를 들면?

228
00:11:50,683 --> 00:11:52,216
나도 모르지

229
00:11:52,218 --> 00:11:53,851
도마뱀은 팔다리가다시 자라고

230
00:11:54,957 --> 00:11:57,054
코지마, 키아라는도마뱀이 아니거든

231
00:11:57,056 --> 00:11:58,322
그렇지, 그래

232

애한테 유전적인 질병이있는지 보라고 할께

237

네 요구대로?

287
00:14:30,064 --> 00:14:31,565
각 표본에서 4천개이상의 염기열을

288
00:14:31,567 --> 00:14:33,273
배열하고 분석했어

289
00:14:33,274 --> 00:14:35,200

당신과 함께하기 위해그들의 고통과 상처를

352
00:17:19,573 --> 00:17:21,671
한쪽으로 하고 커다란인내심을 보여주셨답니다

353
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:26,945
음, 도니,모두에 앞서

354
00:17:26,947 --> 00:17:28,476
먼저 시작해주시지않으시겠어요

355
00:17:28,477 --> 00:17:29,522
어..

356
00:17:30,072 --> 00:17:31,118
예

357
00:17:33,889 --> 00:17:35,354
앨리슨

358
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:38,016
약이나..

359
00:17:38,017 --> 00:17:39,696
음주는

360
00:17:39,697 --> 00:17:41,293
그만 두길 바래

361
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:47,265
내가 얼마나 힘들었었는지당신은 모르는거 같거든

362
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:49,721
계속되는 비난에

363
00:17:49,722 --> 00:17:51,207
괴롭힌거나..

364
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,638
구체적으로하셔도 되요, 도니

365
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:59,457
날 골프채로때렸고

366
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:03,475
뜨거운 접착제로내 가슴에 화상을 입히고

367
00:18:03,476 --> 00:18:05,402
아직도 목욕할 때면아프다고, 앨리슨

368
00:18:05,403 --> 00:18:06,475
도니..

369
00:18:06,476 --> 00:18:09,145
앨리슨, 지금 당장은사실 그냥 들어만

370
00:18:09,146 --> 00:18:10,956
주시려고 노력하는 것이중요합니다

371
00:18:11,374 --> 00:18:12,613
앤슬리?

372
00:18:13,619 --> 00:18:15,261
앨리슨

373
00:18:15,263 --> 00:18:17,797
네가 내 남편을이용하고

374
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:19,978
내 결혼까지도망쳐버렸지

375
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:24,002
날 협박하고공격했지

376
00:18:24,004 --> 00:18:26,738
그래도 진짜로 아픈건네가 우리의 우정에

377
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,736
등을 돌렸다는거라생각해

378
00:18:29,204 --> 00:18:30,635
도니얘기 좀 해라..

379
00:18:30,636 --> 00:18:31,763
엄마!

380
00:18:33,347 --> 00:18:37,351
이게 당신과 나만의문제가 아니야, 앨리슨

381
00:18:37,352 --> 00:18:39,174
우리 애들도 있어

382
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:42,789
당신 정말 우리 가족이깨져버리길 바래?

383
00:18:49,298 --> 00:18:50,632
앨리슨

384
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:12,120
2분이에요

385
00:19:12,122 --> 00:19:13,930
2분이라고?

386
00:19:13,931 --> 00:19:16,435
그게 내가, 너하고2년 동안 있던 전부야?

387
00:19:24,367 --> 00:19:25,701
그건 누구에요?

388
00:19:25,703 --> 00:19:27,403
필릭스 도킨스

389
00:19:27,405 --> 00:19:29,735
너 닮은 사람, 사라 매닝의수양 동생이지

390
00:19:31,176 --> 00:19:32,625
예, 그래서요?

391
00:19:32,626 --> 00:19:34,711
몇 주 전에이자 집에 들렸었지

392
00:19:34,713 --> 00:19:36,275
트렁크엔7만5천 달러가 있었고

393
00:19:39,109 --> 00:19:39,111
너 동네 뜨려는거내가 잡았던 날 말야

394
00:19:41,545 --> 00:19:43,450
전부가 매기 첸 총격사건으로되돌아 가고 있어

395
00:19:45,682 --> 00:19:45,684
그러길 바라는거아니시죠, 아트

396
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:49,021
매기 첸 손에 전화길쥐어준건 선배에요

397
00:19:51,288 --> 00:19:51,290
그게 사고였던 것처럼꾸미는데 도운건 선배라고요

398
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:53,392
난 내 파트너를도우려고 했던거야

399
00:19:55,626 --> 00:19:55,628
이게 나한테털어놓을

400
00:19:57,261 --> 00:20:01,265
마지막 기회야베스

401
00:20:02,699 --> 00:20:43,505
서로 할 일이나 하죠

402
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:44,841
사라, 니가 맞았어

403
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:46,210
내가 틀렸더라

404
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:48,712
오라, 너 코지마가지고뭘 한거야?

405
00:20:50,178 --> 00:20:50,180
전화한거 분명그애 아니거든

406
00:20:51,546 --> 00:20:51,548
하 하

407
00:20:53,147 --> 00:20:53,149
알았어, 들어봐..

408
00:20:55,417 --> 00:20:55,419
놈들은 우리 DNA로우릴 구분할 수 있어

409
00:20:57,085 --> 00:20:57,087
그걸로 네가 베스가아니란 걸 안거지

410
00:20:59,088 --> 00:20:59,090
그럼 우리가 유전적으로동일하지 않다는거야?

411
00:21:00,222 --> 00:21:00,224
그래야 하는데

412
00:21:01,691 --> 00:21:01,693
인위적인 배열이 있어

413
00:21:04,594 --> 00:21:04,596
이게 정확히 뭔지는모르겠는데

414
00:21:06,263 --> 00:21:06,265
어쨌든, 바코드 같은거지아마

415
00:21:07,965 --> 00:21:07,967
아마 우릴 구분짖는 방법일꺼야머, 그걸로 올리비에가

416
00:21:10,467 --> 00:21:10,469
내가 베스 아니란걸알게된건 설명이 되는데

417
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:13,799
그래도 리키가내 이름을 어떻게 알았는지설명은 되지 않거든

418
00:21:13,801 --> 00:21:15,234
네가 누군지 안다고?

419
00:21:15,236 --> 00:21:17,637
그래, 거기다 우리가연락하고 있단 것도 알아

420
00:21:17,639 --> 00:21:19,438
델피네한테 무슨얘기한거 아니야?

421
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,924
아니야, 사라아니, 내가..

422
00:21:22,925 --> 00:21:24,777
놈들이 키아라한테한발짝 더 다가온거거든

423
00:21:25,236 --> 00:21:27,012
어..

424
00:21:27,014 --> 00:21:28,547
알았어, 나 절대

425
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:31,567
너나 키아라 얘기는안했거든

426
00:21:32,668 --> 00:21:34,720
네가 우리 중에서

427
00:21:34,722 --> 00:21:36,154
처음으로 아이를가진 애거든

428
00:21:36,156 --> 00:21:38,190
그러니까복제인간의 자식에

429
00:21:38,192 --> 00:21:39,491
대해선 분류체계조차 없단거야

430
00:21:39,493 --> 00:21:41,500
머, 어쨌거나니가 원하던건 얻었네

431
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:42,928
나 곧 리키를만날꺼거든

432
00:21:44,731 --> 00:21:46,516
정말로?

433
00:21:48,195 --> 00:21:50,568
기회 한번 줘봐

434
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:52,337
너 아마도놀랠꺼야

435
00:21:52,339 --> 00:21:53,905
그 사람들우릴 아껴주거든

436
00:21:53,907 --> 00:21:55,806
그 사람들..그래야하고

437
00:21:55,808 --> 00:21:58,843
알았어, 난 그놈 머리에총구를 들이댈 생각이였거든

438
00:22:03,304 --> 00:22:05,048
이런 방지책에죄송합니다

439
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,349
아니, 아니전적으로 이해한다네

440
00:22:36,193 --> 00:22:37,596
안녕, 사라

441
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:42,495
리키 박사

442
00:22:45,643 --> 00:22:47,542
너도 이 일이 어떻게 된건지정보를 모았겠지

443
00:22:48,049 --> 00:22:50,183
거기엔 나도 대답 못하는많은 질문들이 있단다

444
00:22:50,185 --> 00:22:51,818
그걸로는충분치 않거든요

445
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,687
자네가 짜증나는 것도이해하네만

446
00:22:53,689 --> 00:22:56,957
올리비에나 폴처럼나도 내 부분밖에 모르네

447
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:59,026
그렇담당신 부분은 뭐죠?

448
00:22:59,028 --> 00:23:01,128
데이타 수집을감독하고

449
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,030
너희의 안녕을계량화 하는거지

450
00:23:03,032 --> 00:23:04,806
난..

451
00:23:05,734 --> 00:23:07,311
난 너희를보살피는거야

452
00:23:07,448 --> 00:23:09,069
난 아니죠

453
00:23:09,071 --> 00:23:10,370
아니지

454
00:23:10,372 --> 00:23:11,871
어떻겐지자넨 빠졌지

455
00:23:11,873 --> 00:23:15,074
세상에 이런..그냥 왜인지나 말해요!

456
00:23:15,076 --> 00:23:16,676
이게 전부뭐하는 거죠?

457
00:23:16,678 --> 00:23:18,177
우리 더 얘기해야지사라

458
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:19,345
훨씬 많은거

459
00:23:19,347 --> 00:23:20,880
그래도 한가지합의해야 할게 있어

460
00:23:20,882 --> 00:23:22,174
중대한 사항이지

461
00:23:23,351 --> 00:23:24,917
헬레나

462
00:23:26,094 --> 00:23:27,307
공통의 적이지

463
00:23:27,308 --> 00:23:28,272
분명하네

464
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:30,523
올리비에 말로는 그녀가토마스 얘기를 했다며요. 누구죠?

465
00:23:30,525 --> 00:23:32,369
중요한 질문이네

466
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,158
거기다 내가대답할 수 있기도하고

467
00:23:35,121 --> 00:23:38,365
토마스를 우리 반대세력이야일반적인 과학이지

468
00:23:38,367 --> 00:23:40,534
종교적 극단주의자들이지

469
00:23:40,536 --> 00:23:43,749
프로리씨안*, 그렇게 부르더군 *굳이 해석하면-죽음을 지지하는 자들

470
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,340
그렇네요, 신진화론자가좀 낫네요

471
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:47,842
수년 전그쪽 요원 하나가

472
00:23:47,844 --> 00:23:49,443
우리 프로젝트에잠입해 들어왔지

473
00:23:49,445 --> 00:23:52,046
매기 첸,베스가 쏜 여자죠

474
00:23:52,048 --> 00:23:53,147
그렇네

475
00:23:53,149 --> 00:23:55,449
그녀와 토마스가수녀원에 있는 헬레나를

476
00:23:55,451 --> 00:23:58,486
찾아내고선, 복제인간이복제인간을 죽이도록 훈련시켰네

477
00:23:59,296 --> 00:24:00,855
영리하지, 정말이야

478
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:02,819
영리하네요, 정말

479
00:24:05,128 --> 00:24:07,070
그래서, 어떻게요내가 그앨 죽였으면 하세요?

480
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:09,465
아니지, 우린 전혀그앨 해칠 생각이 없네

481
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,700
자네가 그녈데려와주길 바라지

482
00:24:11,702 --> 00:24:14,235
그럼 우리가재교육시키고

필요한 도움을줄 수 있을꺼네

484
00:24:16,346 --> 00:24:18,259
자네가그렇게 해주면

485
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,741
우리는새로운 이해에서

486
00:24:19,743 --> 00:24:21,533
앞으로 나아갈수 있게되지

487
00:24:21,534 --> 00:24:24,313

자유로운 삶을 살게 될껄세감시자도 없고

00:24:26,617 --> 00:24:28,717
아, 당신이 우리한테삶을 주시겠다고요?

00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:30,386

00:24:30,388 --> 00:24:32,755
감독 받지는 않았었네관찰만이였지

492
00:24:32,757 --> 00:24:34,614
자네 경우만 빼고

너 괜찮지?

00:25:14,668 --> 00:25:16,134
너는?

502
00:25:17,001 --> 00:25:19,170
머, 그랬었는데..

503
00:25:24,047 --> 00:25:25,777
델피네 코미에르

504
00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:27,012
베로우아니더라

505
00:25:27,014 --> 00:25:28,914
벌써 면역학에서박사학위도 땄고

506
00:25:28,916 --> 00:25:30,324
아니야?

507
00:25:31,012 --> 00:25:33,419
저..정말..

508
00:25:33,421 --> 00:25:34,687
정말 미안해

509
00:25:35,663 --> 00:25:38,157
내가정말 멍청하지

510
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,224

이 모든 걸알아냈잖아

513
00:25:42,029 --> 00:25:45,197
그래, 니가 실수로흘리고간 그 성적표나

514
00:25:45,199 --> 00:25:47,299
파리에 있는가짜 남자친구나

515
00:25:47,301 --> 00:25:48,668
리키 박사가 누군지모르는 척 했던거나

516
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:50,503
다 헛짓거린지알았지

517
00:25:50,505 --> 00:25:53,106
그래도 네가 계속내편이라고 생각했어

518
00:25:54,631 --> 00:25:56,557
널 믿고 싶었다고

519
00:25:56,558 --> 00:25:58,179
너 나 믿어도 돼

520
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:00,515
내가 이 여자애들을 안다고리키한테 말했잖아!

날 봐바

523
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:05,753
네가 위험에처해있다고 했단말야

524
00:26:05,755 --> 00:26:07,305
무슨 위험?!

525
00:26:08,874 --> 00:26:11,559
모르잖아알어?

526
00:26:12,835 --> 00:26:14,362
몰라

527
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:17,156
그럼 니가 진짜 위험이네델피네

528
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:24,105
앨리슨, 너 이러면일만 악화되는거야

529
00:26:24,107 --> 00:26:26,607
나 필릭스하고만말하고 싶어

530
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,821
이거 전부 앤슬리야

531
00:26:39,823 --> 00:26:41,376
그년이 다들끌고 온거지

532
00:26:41,377 --> 00:26:42,974
이것도 전부실험에 일부분이야

533
00:26:42,975 --> 00:26:45,660
그래, 친구들과사랑하는 이들 사이서

534
00:26:45,662 --> 00:26:47,595
망신당하는 의식에서복제인간은 어떻게 반응하는가?

535
00:26:47,597 --> 00:26:48,950
매력적이네

536
00:26:50,244 --> 00:26:51,665
어이!

537
00:26:52,867 --> 00:26:54,268
나도 줄꺼?

538
00:27:03,646 --> 00:27:05,512
어쩌면 앤슬리만이아닐지도

539
00:27:06,303 --> 00:27:07,915
어쩌면 전부가감시자인 거야

540
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,483
목사님은좋아보이시던데

541
00:27:09,485 --> 00:27:11,319
사실 좀섹시한 편이더라

542
00:27:11,321 --> 00:27:12,954
사제복만 입으면그걸로 끝이지

543
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,759
필릭스,나 어떻게 해야될까?

544
00:27:22,793 --> 00:27:25,876
턱 높이 올리고여자가 되는거야

545
00:27:26,505 --> 00:27:28,848
그게 뒤통수치기개론이거든

546
00:27:30,907 --> 00:27:32,308
저기 돌아가지못하겠어

547
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,610
당연히 할 수 있지

548
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:36,646
나가서 음악을마주하고

549
00:27:36,648 --> 00:27:38,480
맛없는 파이도좀 먹고

550
00:27:38,482 --> 00:27:40,713
껴안아줘쥐죽은 척 하고

551
00:27:40,714 --> 00:27:42,250
앤슬리는 자기가이겼다고 생각할꺼야

552
00:27:42,252 --> 00:27:44,731
그럼 넌 다음 전투까지살아남는거지

553
00:27:57,293 --> 00:27:58,626
오, 이런

554
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,761
나 화장하는거좀 도와줄레?

555
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,596
기쁜 맘으로

556
00:28:52,734 --> 00:28:54,734
헬레나가계속 안받네요

557
00:28:55,747 --> 00:28:57,645
너 어쩔 셈이니

558
00:28:57,646 --> 00:28:59,380
리키한테그앨 넘겨주려고?

559
00:28:59,518 --> 00:29:01,107
모르겠어요

560
00:29:01,109 --> 00:29:02,737
그자가 그애한테정말로

561
00:29:02,738 --> 00:29:03,976
뭘 하려는건지모르겠다고요, 예?

562
00:29:03,978 --> 00:29:05,411
그게 상관은 있니?

563
00:29:05,413 --> 00:29:06,912
그년이 네 딸을쫓아왔는데도

564
00:29:06,914 --> 00:29:10,364
예, 제 속에서는 그년한테총알을 박아주라는데,

565
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,552
이런게 어떤건지이해 못하실 꺼에요

566
00:29:13,554 --> 00:29:15,887
제가 헬레나를 보면제가 보여요

567
00:29:15,889 --> 00:29:18,790
너 걔한테 뭐빚진거 없다, 사라

568
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:23,494
내가, 음..

569
00:29:23,496 --> 00:29:26,363
내가 영국에 있는사람들한테 연락해 봤다

570
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:27,798
진짜 니가 어디서온건지 물어봤지

571
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,251
그래서요?

572
00:29:30,214 --> 00:29:32,636
다시 연락주겠다고말은 했는데,

573
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:34,505
겁을 먹더구나

574
00:29:34,507 --> 00:29:37,441
그쪽에서도 뭔가일어나고 있는 것 같더라

575
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:42,480
이러지마, 코지마

576
00:29:42,482 --> 00:29:43,982
너 어디로 가려고?

577
00:29:43,984 --> 00:29:45,584
왜, 너보고 리키한테일러바치라고?

578
00:29:45,586 --> 00:29:47,585
내가 진짜 멍청했지!

579
00:29:48,303 --> 00:29:49,843
너 또 무슨 말 했어?

580
00:29:49,844 --> 00:29:51,222
없어!

581
00:29:51,224 --> 00:29:52,991
이름 일곱개뿐이야

582
00:29:52,993 --> 00:29:55,159
키아라 얘긴 안했어

583
00:29:56,762 --> 00:29:58,229
그애 변칙이야너도 알지?

584
00:29:58,231 --> 00:30:01,099
델피네날 이용해도 좋아

585
00:30:01,101 --> 00:30:02,400
그건 괜찮아

586
00:30:02,402 --> 00:30:04,319
하지만, 그 어린 아이근처에도 가면안돼

587
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,916
안그랬어하지도 않을꺼고!

588
00:30:05,917 --> 00:30:07,138
나가!

589
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,307
제발 내 말 들어봐

590
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:11,175
나 이거 한가지만말할께

591
00:30:11,177 --> 00:30:12,570
그냥 듣기만 해

592
00:30:14,552 --> 00:30:16,715
나 너한테 빠져들고싶지 않았어

593
00:30:16,717 --> 00:30:18,417
그러기로한 것도 아니였고

594
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:22,065
근데 그래버렸어

595
00:30:22,066 --> 00:30:25,524
내가 어떻게 그 말을믿을 수가 있겠어, 델피네?

596
00:30:25,526 --> 00:30:27,026
너 느끼고 있으니까!

597
00:30:28,062 --> 00:30:30,496
아니야..거짓말 아니야

598
00:30:30,498 --> 00:30:32,164
할 수도 없고

599
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:35,234
나 예전에 여자랑지내본 적도 없는거 알잖아

600
00:30:35,236 --> 00:30:37,118
그래, 그렇게 보였지

601
00:30:49,705 --> 00:30:51,817
23번, 맞죠?

602
00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:53,585
예, 동쪽 승차장이요북쪽 끝에

603
00:30:53,587 --> 00:30:56,255
제가 다른 쪽에 있었는데탈선기 고정한 쪽이요

604
00:30:56,257 --> 00:30:58,125
저 여자에요

605
00:31:01,227 --> 00:31:02,828
참 안됐어요

606
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,095
베스잖아

607
00:31:04,097 --> 00:31:06,732
그리고는 다른 아가씨가걸어왔죠

608
00:31:17,777 --> 00:31:19,645
저렇게뛰어내렸죠

609
00:31:23,583 --> 00:31:25,450
자, 잠깐요거기 돌려봐요

610
00:31:25,452 --> 00:31:27,286
됐어요.. 그만바로 거기요

611
00:31:27,288 --> 00:31:28,487
젠장

612
00:31:28,488 --> 00:31:30,028
이쪽 각도로는저도 못 봤었네요

613
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,656
헬레나

614
00:32:04,658 --> 00:32:05,657
사라!

615
00:32:07,427 --> 00:32:10,127
내가 진짜 의지할 수있는건 너뿐이거든

616
00:32:17,205 --> 00:32:18,909
함정이 아니라고네가 어떻게 아니?

617
00:32:18,911 --> 00:32:20,646
확실하댔어요

618
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:21,774
함정이야

619
00:32:22,132 --> 00:32:23,516
어쨌든, 이제 그녀가어딨는지 아니까

620
00:32:23,517 --> 00:32:24,754
그냥 리키한테줘버리는거야

621
00:32:24,755 --> 00:32:26,213
이 점에 대해선저애 말에 동의해야겠구나

622
00:32:26,214 --> 00:32:29,186
그리고 나선요?그땐 리키랑 한편될꺼고

623
00:32:29,188 --> 00:32:30,618
그럼 그자가 키아라에대해 알게 될꺼라고요

624
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:31,304
사라..

625
00:32:31,305 --> 00:32:33,038
이번엔 저도 어떻게해야될지 모르겠다고요

626
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:36,393
됐어요? 그냥..잠깐 있어보시라고요

627
00:32:41,867 --> 00:32:43,948
안녕, 너 깼구나

628
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:46,404
기분은 어떠니?

629
00:32:46,406 --> 00:32:47,506
피곤해요

630
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:48,552
그래

631
00:32:50,144 --> 00:32:51,909
너 크게 부딪혔단다

632
00:32:52,547 --> 00:32:55,514
그래도 곧괜찮아질꺼야

633
00:32:55,516 --> 00:32:58,500
헬레나 잘못 아니에요

634
00:32:59,518 --> 00:33:00,674
뭐?

635
00:33:00,675 --> 00:33:03,254
제가 아줌마랑놀려고 나갔어요

636
00:33:04,252 --> 00:33:06,096
그렇게 말하라고시킨거니?

637
00:33:07,061 --> 00:33:08,146
아니요

638
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,060
아줌만 위험해

639
00:33:10,062 --> 00:33:13,029
머리 속에 아픈게 있어서우리를 다치게 하려고해

640
00:33:13,031 --> 00:33:15,023
엄마 도움이필요한거에요

641
00:33:16,454 --> 00:33:17,700
미안하다, 키아라

642
00:33:17,702 --> 00:33:19,955
지금은 누구라도 헬레나를도와줄 수 없을거 같구나

643
00:33:39,193 --> 00:33:40,558
앨리슨

644
00:33:41,109 --> 00:33:45,829
네가 채드하고 밴에있었던거 봤어

645
00:33:45,831 --> 00:33:47,289
우리 애들도 봤고

646
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:49,099
내가 단지 바라는건네가 얼마나 많은 피해를

647
00:33:49,101 --> 00:33:50,533

00:33:50,535 --> 00:33:53,803
내 말은, 모두가널 신뢰한다는 거야

난 널 도와주려고이러는거야

655
00:34:06,185 --> 00:34:07,684
그래서너한테 고마워

656
00:34:10,016 --> 00:34:12,323
내가 이 어항 속으로이사 온 날부터

657

내 생활 하나하나까지도자세히 봐줘서

658
00:34:15,028 --> 00:34:18,829
넌 나에 대한 소문을캐묻고 염탐해왔지

659
00:34:18,831 --> 00:34:21,999
내가 네 소유물인양,네 개인 실험 대상인 것 처럼

660
00:34:22,001 --> 00:34:23,801
너라면 좋아하겠니?

661
00:34:23,803 --> 00:34:26,970
내가 네 생활을속에서부터 드러내면?

662
00:34:26,972 --> 00:34:29,763
만약 내가 여기 모두한테채드, 네 남편이

663
00:34:29,764 --> 00:34:32,097
나보다 훨씬 전부터자전거 강사하고

664
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:33,432
잔다는걸 얘기한다거나

665
00:34:33,434 --> 00:34:34,834
또 어쩜 네 남편의그런 행동이

666
00:34:34,836 --> 00:34:38,704

그말이무슨 뜻이지 아니?

699

내게도 느껴져

710
00:38:15,942 --> 00:38:17,462

00:38:30,688 --> 00:38:32,580
널 다치게한 것처럼

717

당신이 날이렇게 만들었어

718
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,292
헬레나

니가 뭔지 안다

그렇지, 내가열쇠를 가진 사람이야

721
00:39:16,649 --> 00:39:18,866
어쩌면 열쇠를리키 박사한테 줄꺼고

722
00:39:23,996 --> 00:39:25,361
일어서

723
00:39:32,957 --> 00:39:34,256

사라

758
00:41:52,037 --> 00:41:54,459
내가 널 낳은 엄마야

759
00:41:59,454 --> 00:42:04,051
그래, 네가 기대하던사람은 아닐꺼다

760
00:42:04,956 --> 00:42:07,026
기대같은건버렸거든요

761
00:42:07,027 --> 00:42:09,679
이렇게 오게되서미안하구나, 그래도

762
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,725
날 찾는다는얘길 전해들었을 때

763
00:42:11,727 --> 00:42:13,224
서둘러 캐이프타운*을 나왔어야했다*남아프리카공화국 수도

764
00:42:13,595 --> 00:42:16,226
난 감시당하고 있었다이해하지

765
00:42:17,217 --> 00:42:19,440
이렇게 세월이 지나서도놈들이..

766
00:42:21,026 --> 00:42:22,787
놈들이 날 다시찾아냈지

767
00:42:23,671 --> 00:42:28,106
22살 밖에 안됐었지새로운 나라였고

768
00:42:28,108 --> 00:42:30,175
부자 부부가 나한테

769
00:42:30,176 --> 00:42:31,762
시험관 아기 대리모가되달라고 부탁했다

770
00:42:31,763 --> 00:42:35,481
나한테 돈을 주고런던에 잠자리와

771
00:42:35,483 --> 00:42:37,049
법적 절차도 처리해줬지

772
00:42:37,051 --> 00:42:39,838
근데 뭔가 어긋났다

773
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:41,988
의료검사는 과하게했고

774
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:43,490
흘려듣기로는 그부부가

775
00:42:43,492 --> 00:42:44,813
의사들을 데려다가

776
00:42:44,814 --> 00:42:48,200
아이를 전통에서벗어나야게 한다고 하더라

777
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,732
무슨 진보된..

778
00:42:51,734 --> 00:42:54,168
진화, 그런거였지

779
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:55,736
신진화요?

780
00:42:55,738 --> 00:42:58,621
그래, 근데 그들이부부가 전혀 아니였다

781
00:42:58,622 --> 00:43:00,382
과학자들이였지

782
00:43:00,383 --> 00:43:03,773
내가 배고있 아이는그들에게 의미가 없었어

783
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:09,284
내 안에 있는 생명이위험에 처했다는걸 알게됐다

784
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:10,719
그래서 도망쳤지

785
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:16,057
숨어서 몰래너희 둘을 낳은거다

786
00:43:16,059 --> 00:43:17,824
저희 둘이요?

787
00:43:17,825 --> 00:43:21,258
그래, 쌍둥이 였다

788
00:43:21,721 --> 00:43:25,466
너희를 데리고 있지못한다는걸 알았지

789
00:43:26,056 --> 00:43:27,596
그래서 널 숨겨 보냈다..

790
00:43:27,597 --> 00:43:29,777
하나는 기관에다가하나는 교회에다가

791
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:33,641
헬레나

792
00:00:04,528 --> 00:00:06,749
They knew I wasn't Bethfrom the medical tests.

793
00:00:06,751 --> 00:00:08,206
You said our DNA was identical.

794
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:10,430
It is. You know, maybe it was

795
00:00:10,432 --> 00:00:11,964
your sunny personality that gave you away.

796
00:00:11,966 --> 00:00:13,569
Who the hell is Maggie Chen?

797
00:00:13,571 --> 00:00:14,976
That's the woman Beth shot.

798
00:00:14,978 --> 00:00:17,112
Maggie helped make you.

799
00:00:17,114 --> 00:00:18,613
Then she saw the light.

800
00:00:18,615 --> 00:00:20,516
Beth killed her to protect us.

801
00:00:20,518 --> 00:00:23,555
Art, you got to see this. It'sa match on the Jane Doe print.

802
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:24,989
Why the hell does she look like Beth?

803
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:27,752
Paul... reports to Olivier, his handler.

804
00:00:27,754 --> 00:00:30,283
You just rest and heal.

805
00:00:30,285 --> 00:00:31,850
Dig faster.

806
00:00:31,852 --> 00:00:33,482
Cosima's safety is at stake.

807
00:00:33,484 --> 00:00:35,350
Well, she's not only researching

808
00:00:35,352 --> 00:00:36,784
her own biology,

809
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:38,150
but she is aware of eight others.

810
00:00:38,152 --> 00:00:40,250
I think he's my watcher.

811
00:00:40,252 --> 00:00:42,686
I think that I may havespotted her real monitor.

812
00:00:42,688 --> 00:00:44,820
You want to mess with my life?

813
00:00:44,822 --> 00:00:47,920
I'm going to mess with yours.

814
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:49,654
I don't want to divorce Donnie,

815
00:00:49,656 --> 00:00:51,989
but I can't keep lying to him.

816
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:53,357
So what if we tell them?

817
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:55,158
Siobhan, this is

818
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,158
Alison Hendrix.

819
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,294
What happened to you?

820
00:00:58,296 --> 00:00:59,696
I don't know.

821
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:00,998
Kira! Kira, no!

822
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,369
7-year-old femalestruck by a vehicle.

823
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:11,637
GCS 3,

824
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:13,505
chest injury, possible internal bleeding.

825
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:15,640
- Stay with me, baby, please.- 3 minutes.

826
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:17,509
We're here, love. We're right here.

827
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:19,110
Let's get her typedand crossed for 3 units.

828
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:22,447
- We're right here. Please.- Excuse me, excuse me.

829
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:24,114
This is as far as you go.

830
00:01:24,116 --> 00:01:25,115
No, no, no!

831
00:01:25,117 --> 00:01:26,650
Sarah, Sarah.

832
00:01:27,853 --> 00:01:30,020
We have to let them do their job.

833
00:01:30,022 --> 00:01:35,324
On 3. 1, 2, 3!

834
00:01:35,326 --> 00:01:36,892
I want an ultrasound and a trauma series:

835
00:01:36,894 --> 00:01:38,693
Chest, pelvic, C-spine.Let's get a level 1 on standby

836
00:01:38,695 --> 00:01:41,662
and a crash cart. We may have to intubate.

837
00:01:41,664 --> 00:01:42,930
- O.R.'s being prepped.- Good.

838
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,536
I should've known Helena would find us.

839
00:01:49,538 --> 00:01:50,971
I should've stopped her.

840
00:01:54,476 --> 00:01:56,510
I won't have you blaming yourself.

841
00:01:56,512 --> 00:01:58,512
You did not bring this on.

842
00:01:58,514 --> 00:02:00,415
She's going to be okay, Sarah.

843
00:02:00,417 --> 00:02:02,618
She has to be.

844
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,853
Mm-hmm.

845
00:02:03,855 --> 00:02:05,588
Can I get anybody some coffee?

846
00:02:07,358 --> 00:02:10,127
Alison, I know you mean well,

847
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:11,628
I know you do, it's just...

848
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,130
Um, I know, I know. I'm in the way.

849
00:02:13,132 --> 00:02:14,431
Yeah.

850
00:02:14,433 --> 00:02:16,467
I just can't help but feel like

851
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,269
it's my daughter in there.

852
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:21,172
You should go home.

853
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:22,573
You should get some sleep.

854
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:26,076
I can't go home, Felix. I...

855
00:02:26,078 --> 00:02:28,279
I assaulted my monitor.

856
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,847
I'm going to get black-bagged like Sarah

857
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:33,617
and carted off to God knows where.

858
00:02:33,619 --> 00:02:35,519
All right,

859
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:38,222
use my place, then.

860
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:39,657
Okay. Thank you.

861
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,826
I'll call you if we hear anything.

862
00:02:48,233 --> 00:02:49,467
Okay.

863
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:55,607
Ultrasound's up.

864
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:58,410
Heart rate's at 80.

865
00:02:58,412 --> 00:03:00,546
85/50.

866
00:03:00,548 --> 00:03:03,982
Doctor, you need to see this.

867
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,836
What's happening?

868
00:03:22,838 --> 00:03:25,939
It looks like Kira's going to be okay.

869
00:03:25,941 --> 00:03:29,142
What does "looks like" mean?

870
00:03:29,144 --> 00:03:31,011
Well, she's been sedated,but her blood pressure

871
00:03:31,013 --> 00:03:32,512
and breathing have stabilized.

872
00:03:32,514 --> 00:03:34,014
Her ribs are intact, there's no

873
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,183
internal bleeding, no head trauma.

874
00:03:36,185 --> 00:03:38,285
I think she's gonna be fine.

875
00:03:38,287 --> 00:03:40,921
She was run right over.

876
00:03:40,923 --> 00:03:42,356
I saw it.

877
00:03:42,358 --> 00:03:44,792
Then she's a very lucky girl.

878
00:03:44,794 --> 00:03:46,293
She's okay.

879
00:03:46,295 --> 00:03:48,763
She's okay, she's okay, she's okay.

880
00:03:48,765 --> 00:03:50,631
She's okay.

881
00:03:55,806 --> 00:03:57,472
My baby.

882
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:57,630
Mummy, she looks like you.

883
00:04:57,632 --> 00:04:58,831
She looks like mummy.

884
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:01,200
Shh shh shh, shh shh.

885
00:05:01,202 --> 00:05:02,968
Just sleep now, monkey.

886
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,973
I'll keep you safe from her.

887
00:05:06,975 --> 00:05:08,041
I promise.

888
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:19,952
There was a girl,

889
00:05:19,954 --> 00:05:21,320
a little girl.

890
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:22,588
Easy, child.

891
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,023
Pull yourself together.

892
00:05:24,025 --> 00:05:25,624
Sarah is a mother.

893
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:27,326
That's ridiculous!

894
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:29,829
It's not possible.

895
00:05:36,672 --> 00:05:39,373
The girl was hit by a car because of me.

896
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,810
She's all right?

897
00:05:41,812 --> 00:05:46,548
Yeah, yeah, she's fast asleep.

898
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,117
How about you, then?

899
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:50,352
Are you thanking your lucky stars?

900
00:05:50,354 --> 00:05:52,187
I don't believe in miracles.

901
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:54,322
Kids are made of rubber, Sarah.

902
00:05:54,324 --> 00:05:56,558
She got lucky,

903
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,993
just like the doctor said.

904
00:05:57,995 --> 00:05:59,728
You didn't see it.

905
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,630
Count your blessings.

906
00:06:01,632 --> 00:06:02,998
Move on to your worries.

907
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,868
Yeah, Helena's got to go.

908
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:11,372
I got a dozen reasonsto bring Beth back in.

909
00:06:11,374 --> 00:06:12,573
Look, we got three sets of matching prints,

910
00:06:12,575 --> 00:06:14,175
a jumper who looks just like her,

911
00:06:14,177 --> 00:06:15,277
and we got a smooth little rent-boy

912
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:16,644
who's connected to them both.

913
00:06:16,646 --> 00:06:18,313
All right, all right. I know, Angie...

914
00:06:18,315 --> 00:06:19,747
And here, we've got Jane Doe,

915
00:06:19,749 --> 00:06:21,149
the one who started it all.

916
00:06:21,151 --> 00:06:22,383
Bet you 100 bucks Iknow who she's looks like

917
00:06:22,385 --> 00:06:24,385
when Beckwith is donewith the reconstruction.

918
00:06:24,387 --> 00:06:25,720
You got no charge that'll stick yet.

919
00:06:25,722 --> 00:06:27,756
Obstruction. This all comes on the heels

920
00:06:27,758 --> 00:06:29,524
- of that civilian shooting.- So what?!

921
00:06:29,526 --> 00:06:31,260
So she could be protecting the killer.

922
00:06:31,262 --> 00:06:33,529
Shh shh shh shh.

923
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:35,030
How's it going?

924
00:06:35,032 --> 00:06:37,999
Still pushing for a break, sir.

925
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:39,501
Grigson and Chow just solved

926
00:06:39,503 --> 00:06:41,336
that stabbing in the junction.

927
00:06:41,338 --> 00:06:42,770
Maybe you need

928
00:06:42,772 --> 00:06:44,372
a fresh pair of eyes here, huh?

929
00:06:44,374 --> 00:06:46,274
No, we're good, sir. We're good.

930
00:06:46,276 --> 00:06:49,711
Just give us 'til the end of the day.

931
00:06:54,783 --> 00:06:56,150
You want me to throw

932
00:06:56,152 --> 00:06:57,552
my ex-partner under the bus, hmm?

933
00:06:57,554 --> 00:07:00,388
If I'm wrong about this,

934
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,924
you'll be the last partner I ever have.

935
00:07:02,926 --> 00:07:05,426
I don't know, Art.

936
00:07:05,428 --> 00:07:07,461
I'm starting to wonder.

937
00:07:07,463 --> 00:07:10,231
Does she have something on you?

938
00:07:16,571 --> 00:07:17,771
End of day, Angie.

939
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,084
If this is true,

940
00:07:30,086 --> 00:07:31,986
if the child's actually hers...

941
00:07:33,956 --> 00:07:35,456
How could you let her go?

942
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,558
She's innocent.

943
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,159
I did what I was told...

944
00:07:39,161 --> 00:07:41,963
I used Sarah to get to the others.

945
00:07:41,965 --> 00:07:43,298
Then where are the others?!

946
00:07:47,202 --> 00:07:48,636
Why is Sarah still alive?

947
00:07:48,638 --> 00:07:50,805
That man, Olivier!

948
00:07:50,807 --> 00:07:52,840
- I took off his beast-tail for you.- Yes!

949
00:07:52,842 --> 00:07:55,142
To get Dr. Leekie's attention!

950
00:07:55,144 --> 00:07:58,612
The child will be valuable to them.

951
00:08:01,184 --> 00:08:02,283
No, no!

952
00:08:04,053 --> 00:08:06,254
That's her!

953
00:08:07,323 --> 00:08:09,324
Tell her to come here.

954
00:08:09,326 --> 00:08:10,458
Tell her!

955
00:08:12,195 --> 00:08:14,095
Helena.

956
00:08:14,097 --> 00:08:16,031
Is Kira all right?

957
00:08:16,033 --> 00:08:18,633
I'll tell you in person.

958
00:08:18,635 --> 00:08:19,868
Where are you?

959
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,837
It was an accident.

960
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:24,005
Tell her!

961
00:08:36,052 --> 00:08:41,390
Lovely apartment for a young couple.

962
00:08:41,392 --> 00:08:45,794
Ahh!

963
00:08:45,796 --> 00:08:48,397
Very convincing.

964
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,999
Unfortunately,

965
00:08:50,001 --> 00:08:52,668
the lie Olivier told last night was not.

966
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,636
What lie?

967
00:08:54,638 --> 00:08:58,573
Someone tampered with thesecurity footage at club Neolution,

968
00:08:58,575 --> 00:09:01,877
but I know there were two clones there

969
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:05,313
that night, weren't there?

970
00:09:07,183 --> 00:09:08,683
I've searched for the lost clone,

971
00:09:08,685 --> 00:09:10,517
Helena, for years.

972
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:12,819
She's my white whale, Paul!

973
00:09:12,821 --> 00:09:14,421
But she's feral.

974
00:09:14,423 --> 00:09:16,123
She couldn't fool you,

975
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,559
impersonate Beth,

976
00:09:18,561 --> 00:09:20,560
under this roof,

977
00:09:20,562 --> 00:09:24,765
in that bed.

978
00:09:24,767 --> 00:09:27,234
But Sarah Manning could.

979
00:09:42,684 --> 00:09:43,684
Oh!

980
00:10:07,943 --> 00:10:09,009
Oh!

981
00:10:09,011 --> 00:10:11,211
What the hell?!

982
00:10:11,213 --> 00:10:13,247
A simple "thank you" would suffice.

983
00:10:13,249 --> 00:10:15,216
So, Kira's going to be okay?

984
00:10:15,218 --> 00:10:17,218
Yes, miraculous recovery.

985
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,486
Okay.

986
00:10:18,488 --> 00:10:20,721
Uh, where's my, um...

987
00:10:20,723 --> 00:10:22,123
Oh, your...

988
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:25,594
drug paraphernalia is in a drawer.

989
00:10:25,596 --> 00:10:28,464
So is the paraphernaliathat was by your bed.

990
00:10:28,466 --> 00:10:30,566
Did you wash that, too?

991
00:10:30,568 --> 00:10:33,669
My children are at mymother's house right now.

992
00:10:33,671 --> 00:10:35,171
I'm a danger to them.

993
00:10:35,173 --> 00:10:38,006
So I was thinking I could use

994
00:10:38,008 --> 00:10:41,010
this house as a base

995
00:10:41,012 --> 00:10:42,411
while I apartment-hunt.

996
00:10:42,413 --> 00:10:43,479
No!

997
00:10:43,481 --> 00:10:44,980
Well, Donnie's staying clear

998
00:10:44,982 --> 00:10:46,481
of the house for a few hours,

999
00:10:46,483 --> 00:10:48,884
so I just need to go by

1000
00:10:48,886 --> 00:10:51,019
and get some sundries and clothing.

1001
00:10:52,788 --> 00:10:55,991
Fine! You can stay one night.

1002
00:10:55,993 --> 00:10:58,560
Just don't wake me on your way back in.

1003
00:11:01,932 --> 00:11:04,000
Felix.

1004
00:11:04,002 --> 00:11:06,869
Felix.

1005
00:11:06,871 --> 00:11:08,604
I'm a pariah.

1006
00:11:08,606 --> 00:11:10,806
I can't go back there alone.

1007
00:11:10,808 --> 00:11:12,475
Mnh!

1008
00:11:12,477 --> 00:11:14,143
I need you to be my wingman.

1009
00:11:14,145 --> 00:11:18,248
Are you bloody serious?

1010
00:11:21,552 --> 00:11:24,521
Please?

1011
00:11:24,523 --> 00:11:28,325
I need to change.

1012
00:11:28,327 --> 00:11:30,027
Fetch me something gay.

1013
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:32,896
Holy shit, Sarah.

1014
00:11:32,898 --> 00:11:34,397
I'm so relieved.

1015
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,667
Yeah, even the doctors were stumped.

1016
00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:39,069
Do you think, because Kira's mine,

1017
00:11:39,071 --> 00:11:41,205
she might be different?

1018
00:11:41,207 --> 00:11:42,673
Because she's uninjured?

1019
00:11:42,675 --> 00:11:44,108
Yeah, it's just a question.

1020
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:47,444
Well, if they genetically modified us,

1021
00:11:47,446 --> 00:11:49,479
I mean, you could've passedsomething down to her.

1022
00:11:49,481 --> 00:11:50,681
Like what?

1023
00:11:50,683 --> 00:11:52,216
I don't know.

1024
00:11:52,218 --> 00:11:53,851
Lizards regrow limbs.

1025
00:11:53,853 --> 00:11:57,054
Cosima, Kira's not a lizard.

1026
00:11:57,056 --> 00:11:58,322
Right, well,

1027
00:11:58,324 --> 00:11:59,823
it's not magic,

1028
00:11:59,825 --> 00:12:02,225
it's just stem cells, you know?

1029
00:12:02,227 --> 00:12:05,195
Look, I have a guy who's sequencing

1030
00:12:05,197 --> 00:12:06,964
the German's DNA alongside mine,

1031
00:12:06,966 --> 00:12:09,232
to see if the illness she had was genetic.

1032
00:12:09,234 --> 00:12:12,202
If you want, I can give him samples

1033
00:12:12,204 --> 00:12:14,537
of you and Kira, to compare.

1034
00:12:14,539 --> 00:12:16,739
Yeah, I'm not giving you

1035
00:12:16,741 --> 00:12:18,007
our genetic material.

1036
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:20,877
You'd probably hand it over to Delphine.

1037
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:23,446
Dude, I'm just doing what we agreed, okay?

1038
00:12:23,448 --> 00:12:24,847
I'm following the science.

1039
00:12:24,849 --> 00:12:25,948
Yeah, well,

1040
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:28,817
I worry about scientists more than science.

1041
00:12:30,854 --> 00:12:32,287
Got to go.

1042
00:12:35,358 --> 00:12:39,093
Eh, I got it.

1043
00:12:40,596 --> 00:12:42,097
Hey.

1044
00:12:42,099 --> 00:12:44,132
Hey. Coloring books and puzzles.

1045
00:12:44,134 --> 00:12:46,702
She's sleeping.

1046
00:12:46,704 --> 00:12:47,803
Uh, Mrs S,

1047
00:12:47,805 --> 00:12:49,437
this is Paul.

1048
00:12:49,439 --> 00:12:50,805
Pleasure.

1049
00:12:50,807 --> 00:12:51,806
Paul.

1050
00:12:51,808 --> 00:12:53,174
She knows everything.

1051
00:12:53,176 --> 00:12:55,610
Well, not everything, clearly.

1052
00:12:55,612 --> 00:12:57,045
Well,

1053
00:12:57,047 --> 00:12:58,547
don't hold it against me,

1054
00:12:58,549 --> 00:13:00,983
but I have some bad news.

1055
00:13:00,985 --> 00:13:03,118
Dr. Leekie knows who you are, Sarah.

1056
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:08,425
Let go!

1057
00:13:08,427 --> 00:13:09,693
Let go!

1058
00:13:13,398 --> 00:13:15,464
No!

1059
00:13:15,466 --> 00:13:16,866
No! No!

1060
00:13:25,677 --> 00:13:27,176
I gave you everything!

1061
00:13:27,178 --> 00:13:29,779
A reason for living

1062
00:13:29,781 --> 00:13:31,280
and, in return... weakness.

1063
00:13:31,282 --> 00:13:32,815
Tomas.

1064
00:13:32,817 --> 00:13:34,650
No!

1065
00:13:34,652 --> 00:13:38,254
If you protect this forgery,

1066
00:13:38,256 --> 00:13:40,189
you're no better than they are.

1067
00:13:40,191 --> 00:13:41,924
No!

1068
00:13:44,295 --> 00:13:46,295
You're no better than they are!

1069
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,031
Leekie wants to meet?

1070
00:13:58,033 --> 00:13:59,766
He says he wants to make a deal.

1071
00:13:59,768 --> 00:14:01,667
He knows you're aware, incontact with each other.

1072
00:14:01,669 --> 00:14:04,771
How? Did Cosima give me up?

1073
00:14:04,773 --> 00:14:06,873
Look, this is an opportunity.

1074
00:14:08,143 --> 00:14:09,909
You sound exactly like her.

1075
00:14:09,911 --> 00:14:13,613
I don't trust him, either.

1076
00:14:13,615 --> 00:14:15,281
But the genie's out of the bottle.

1077
00:14:16,317 --> 00:14:16,760
For them, too.

1078
00:14:16,776 --> 00:14:20,253
Your interests havealigned. You can get answers.

1079
00:14:20,255 --> 00:14:22,455
Or I could get black-bagged and abducted.

1080
00:14:22,457 --> 00:14:24,924
What if there was a way to meet him safely,

1081
00:14:24,926 --> 00:14:27,994
on your terms?

1082
00:14:30,064 --> 00:14:31,565
Over 4,000 base pairs from each sample,

1083
00:14:31,567 --> 00:14:33,833
sequenced and analyzed.

1084
00:14:33,835 --> 00:14:35,207
Awesome! Awesome.

1085
00:14:37,007 --> 00:14:37,009
Okay, what did you find?

1086
00:14:39,609 --> 00:14:39,611
No markers for respiratory disease.

1087
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:41,212
This sequence is anomalous

1088
00:14:43,579 --> 00:14:43,581
for cytochrome C and then this piece

1089
00:14:45,347 --> 00:14:45,349
is distinct in each sample.

1090
00:14:47,949 --> 00:14:47,951
They're different?

1091
00:14:51,252 --> 00:14:51,254
That's... that's crazy.

1092
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:53,022
What are you looking for, really?

1093
00:14:54,722 --> 00:14:54,724
Not respiratory disease.

1094
00:14:56,657 --> 00:14:56,659
Nope.

1095
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:57,793
Hey.

1096
00:15:00,194 --> 00:15:00,196
Hey!

1097
00:15:01,228 --> 00:15:01,230
Hey.

1098
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:02,632
Scott, this is Delphine.

1099
00:15:03,631 --> 00:15:03,633
Hello.

1100
00:15:05,366 --> 00:15:05,368
Hey.

1101
00:15:08,435 --> 00:15:08,437
I have to run to class,

1102
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:10,272
but I was wondering if I could

1103
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:12,141
come over later.

1104
00:15:14,475 --> 00:15:14,477
Yeah, of course.

1105
00:15:16,144 --> 00:15:18,714
Okay.

1106
00:15:22,117 --> 00:15:26,889
Oof! Wow! Okay!

1107
00:15:28,524 --> 00:15:28,526
Bye.

1108
00:15:29,524 --> 00:15:46,477
Bye.

1109
00:15:47,978 --> 00:15:47,980
If she wakes up, just tell her

1110
00:15:49,446 --> 00:15:49,448
I'm going to be right back.

1111
00:15:51,081 --> 00:15:51,083
And will you?

1112
00:15:54,785 --> 00:15:54,787
Yeah.

1113
00:15:56,353 --> 00:16:00,191
Are you going to be okay here?

1114
00:16:01,992 --> 00:16:01,994
Don't you worry about Helena.

1115
00:16:04,795 --> 00:16:04,797
Your shotgun. Forgot about that.

1116
00:16:06,797 --> 00:16:06,799
One of the great thingsabout this country...

1117
00:16:10,134 --> 00:16:21,613
hunting's not just for the rich.

1118
00:16:24,314 --> 00:16:24,316
Kind of busy, here, Art.

1119
00:16:26,283 --> 00:16:26,285
Pilates can wait, Beth.

1120
00:16:27,618 --> 00:16:27,620
We need to talk.

1121
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:29,121
We already did that.

1122
00:16:30,287 --> 00:16:30,289
Off the record, this time.

1123
00:16:31,488 --> 00:16:31,490
No one else.

1124
00:16:33,724 --> 00:16:33,726
This is your last chance.

1125
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:36,562
Where are you?

1126
00:16:38,963 --> 00:16:38,965
You know I get crow's feet

1127
00:16:41,332 --> 00:16:41,334
if I don't get enough shuteye.

1128
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:45,471
I will have you backon your couch in a jiff.

1129
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:46,907
Oh, my God!

1130
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:48,509
Alison.

1131
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:51,512
Wh... what's going on? What is this?

1132
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:52,947
We're gathered in a spirit

1133
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:54,649
of love and understanding.

1134
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:55,983
Please,

1135
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:57,218
join us.

1136
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:01,721
An intervention?

1137
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:03,991
This is bullshit!

1138
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:05,259
Hello!

1139
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:06,861
Felix. Gay friend.

1140
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,162
Acting coach.

1141
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:10,064
Oh, that's perfectly fine here.

1142
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:11,599
Which one?

1143
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:12,700
Yes, yes.

1144
00:17:14,098 --> 00:17:14,100
Please join us.

1145
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:16,370
Alison, your friendshave shown great strength

1146
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:19,573
in setting aside their pain and hurt

1147
00:17:21,406 --> 00:17:21,408
in order to talk with you today.

1148
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:25,512
Mm-hmm.

1149
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:26,947
Um, Donnie, why don't you

1150
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:28,782
go ahead and get us started.

1151
00:17:30,281 --> 00:17:30,283
Uh...

1152
00:17:32,717 --> 00:17:32,719
Yeah.

1153
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:35,356
Alison,

1154
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:37,658
the pills...

1155
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:39,927
and the drinking,

1156
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:44,030
it has to stop.

1157
00:17:47,265 --> 00:17:47,267
I don't think you know howhard this has been for me.

1158
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:50,304
The constant criticism,

1159
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:51,605
the abuse.

1160
00:17:53,638 --> 00:17:55,742
You can be specific, Donnie.

1161
00:17:59,745 --> 00:17:59,747
You hit me with a golf club.

1162
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:04,318
You burned my chest with hot glue.

1163
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:05,920
It still hurts in the shower, Alison.

1164
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:07,121
Donnie...

1165
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:09,791
Alison, it's actuallyimportant for you to just

1166
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:10,958
try and listen right now.

1167
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:13,261
Aynsley?

1168
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:15,263
Alison,

1169
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:17,799
you took advantage of my husband

1170
00:18:19,978 --> 00:18:21,902
and may have ruined my marriage, too.

1171
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:24,004
You threatened and assaulted me.

1172
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:26,740
But I think what really hurts is that

1173
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:29,343
you turned your back on our friendship.

1174
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:31,345
Donnie, tell her that we...

1175
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:33,347
Mom!

1176
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:37,618
It's not just about you and me, Alison.

1177
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:40,856
It's about our kids.

1178
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:49,298
Do you really want to break up our family?

1179
00:18:50,632 --> 00:19:09,552
Alison.

1180
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:12,122
I have 2 minutes.

1181
00:19:14,322 --> 00:19:14,324
2 minutes?

1182
00:19:16,892 --> 00:19:24,367
That's all I get, for 2 years by your side?

1183
00:19:25,701 --> 00:19:25,703
Who's that?

1184
00:19:27,403 --> 00:19:27,405
Felix Dawkins.

1185
00:19:31,174 --> 00:19:31,176
Your lookalike, SarahManning's, foster brother.

1186
00:19:32,876 --> 00:19:32,878
Yeah, and?

1187
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:36,273
You visited his place a few weeks backwith 75 grand in your trunk,

1188
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:39,109
the day I stopped you from skipping town.

1189
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:41,545
It's all coming back tothe Maggie Chen shooting.

1190
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:45,682
You don't want to go there, Art.

1191
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:49,019
You put the phone in Maggie Chen's hand.

1192
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,288
You helped me make it looklike it was an accident.

1193
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,390
I was trying to help my partner.

1194
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:55,626
This is your last chance

1195
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:57,261
to come clean with me, Beth.

1196
00:20:01,265 --> 00:20:02,699
We do what we gotta do.

1197
00:20:43,505 --> 00:20:44,839
Sarah, you were right.

1198
00:20:44,841 --> 00:20:46,208
I was wrong.

1199
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:48,710
Okay, what have you done with Cosima?

1200
00:20:48,712 --> 00:20:50,178
Because this definitely isn't her.

1201
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,546
Ha ha.

1202
00:20:51,548 --> 00:20:53,147
Okay, listen...

1203
00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:55,417
they can tell us apart by our DNA.

1204
00:20:55,419 --> 00:20:57,085
That's how they knew you weren't Beth.

1205
00:20:57,087 --> 00:20:59,088
So we're not genetically identical?

1206
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:00,222
We should be,

1207
00:21:00,224 --> 00:21:01,691
but there's a synthetic sequence.

1208
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:04,594
I don't know what it is, exactly,

1209
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,263
but it's like a barcode, maybe,

1210
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,965
- maybe a way to differentiate us?- Well, that explains

1211
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,467
how Olivier knew I wasn't Beth,

1212
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,166
but it does not explain

1213
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:13,801
how Leekie knows my name.

1214
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:15,236
He knows who you are?

1215
00:21:17,637 --> 00:21:17,639
Yeah, and he knows we're in contact.

1216
00:21:19,438 --> 00:21:19,440
Did you say something to Delphine?

1217
00:21:23,276 --> 00:21:23,278
No. Sarah, no. I...

1218
00:21:24,777 --> 00:21:24,779
'Cause they're one step closer to Kira.

1219
00:21:27,012 --> 00:21:27,014
Uh...

1220
00:21:28,547 --> 00:21:28,549
Okay, I would never

1221
00:21:31,383 --> 00:21:31,385
say anything about you or Kira.

1222
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:34,722
You are the first one of us

1223
00:21:36,154 --> 00:21:36,156
to ever even have a child.

1224
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:38,192
I mean, there's not even taxonomy

1225
00:21:39,491 --> 00:21:39,493
for the offspring of a clone.

1226
00:21:41,826 --> 00:21:41,828
Well, either way, you got what you wanted,

1227
00:21:42,928 --> 00:21:44,731
'cause I'm about to meet Leekie.

1228
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:47,835
Really?

1229
00:21:50,568 --> 00:21:50,570
Just give him a chance.

1230
00:21:52,337 --> 00:21:52,339
You might be surprised.

1231
00:21:53,905 --> 00:21:53,907
They care about us.

1232
00:21:55,806 --> 00:21:55,808
They... they have to.

1233
00:21:58,843 --> 00:22:03,814
Yeah, I was thinking ofputting a gun to his head.

1234
00:22:05,048 --> 00:22:05,050
Sorry for the precautions.

1235
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:36,381
No no, I understand completely.

1236
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:40,819
Hello, Sarah.

1237
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,013
Dr. Leekie.

1238
00:22:48,047 --> 00:22:48,049
You've gleaned how this works.

1239
00:22:50,183 --> 00:22:50,185
There are many questions I can't answer.

1240
00:22:51,818 --> 00:22:51,820
That's not good enough.

1241
00:22:53,687 --> 00:22:53,689
I understand your frustration, but,

1242
00:22:56,957 --> 00:22:56,959
like Olivier or Paul, I only know my part.

1243
00:22:59,026 --> 00:22:59,028
So, what is your part?

1244
00:23:01,128 --> 00:23:01,130
I oversee data collection

1245
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:03,032
and quantify your well-being.

1246
00:23:05,732 --> 00:23:05,734
I...

1247
00:23:07,034 --> 00:23:07,036
I look after you.

1248
00:23:09,069 --> 00:23:09,071
Not me.

1249
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:10,372
- No.- Mnh-mnh.

1250
00:23:11,871 --> 00:23:11,873
Somehow, you got away.

1251
00:23:15,074 --> 00:23:15,076
Jesus Christ. Just tell me why!

1252
00:23:16,676 --> 00:23:16,678
What is this all about?

1253
00:23:18,177 --> 00:23:18,179
We can go further, Sarah,

1254
00:23:19,345 --> 00:23:19,347
much further,

1255
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:20,882
but we need to come to an agreement

1256
00:23:23,349 --> 00:23:23,351
on something crucial.

1257
00:23:24,917 --> 00:23:24,919
Helena.

1258
00:23:26,986 --> 00:23:26,988
A common enemy,

1259
00:23:28,487 --> 00:23:28,489
obviously.

1260
00:23:30,523 --> 00:23:30,525
Olivier said she mentionedTomas. Who's that?

1261
00:23:32,593 --> 00:23:32,595
Great question,

1262
00:23:34,694 --> 00:23:34,696
and one I can answer.

1263
00:23:38,365 --> 00:23:38,367
Tomas opposes us. Science, in general.

1264
00:23:40,534 --> 00:23:40,536
They're religious extremists.

1265
00:23:44,071 --> 00:23:44,073
Proletheans, they call themselves.

1266
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:46,342
Right, "Neolutionist" is way better.

1267
00:23:47,842 --> 00:23:47,844
Years ago, one of their agents

1268
00:23:49,443 --> 00:23:49,445
infiltrated our project.

1269
00:23:52,046 --> 00:23:52,048
Maggie Chen, the woman Beth shot.

1270
00:23:53,147 --> 00:23:53,149
Yes.

1271
00:23:55,449 --> 00:23:55,451
She and Tomas found Helena in a convent,

1272
00:23:58,486 --> 00:23:58,488
then trained a clone to kill clones.

1273
00:24:00,855 --> 00:24:00,857
Brilliant, really.

1274
00:24:05,126 --> 00:24:05,128
That's brilliant, really.

1275
00:24:08,096 --> 00:24:08,098
So, what, you want me to kill her?

1276
00:24:10,065 --> 00:24:10,067
No, we don't want to harm her at all.

1277
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:11,702
We want you to bring her in

1278
00:24:14,235 --> 00:24:14,237
so we can deprogram her,

1279
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:16,039
get her the help she needs.

1280
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:18,375
You do this,

1281
00:24:19,741 --> 00:24:19,743
and we can move forward

1282
00:24:21,243 --> 00:24:21,245
with a new understanding.

1283
00:24:24,313 --> 00:24:24,315
You and your friends will be free

1284
00:24:26,615 --> 00:24:26,617
to live as you choose, no monitors.

1285
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:28,719
Oh, you're going to give us lives?

1286
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:30,388
You've always had lives.

1287
00:24:32,755 --> 00:24:32,757
They haven't been directed, just observed.

1288
00:24:34,424 --> 00:24:34,426
Except in your case.

1289
00:24:35,992 --> 00:24:35,994
And Helena's.

1290
00:24:38,094 --> 00:24:38,096
Helena's been under their care,

1291
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:41,900
which is far, far worse than ours.

1292
00:24:44,467 --> 00:24:44,469
Bring her in.

1293
00:24:45,969 --> 00:25:02,388
We'll get her the help she needs.

1294
00:25:06,023 --> 00:25:08,627
Bonsoir, ma ch?ie.

1295
00:25:11,128 --> 00:25:13,098
I have the truffles that I promised you.

1296
00:25:14,666 --> 00:25:14,668
Are you okay?

1297
00:25:16,134 --> 00:25:16,136
Are you?

1298
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:24,310
Well, I was, but...

1299
00:25:25,777 --> 00:25:25,779
Delphine Cormier,

1300
00:25:27,312 --> 00:25:27,314
not Beraud.

1301
00:25:28,714 --> 00:25:28,716
You've already got your doctorate

1302
00:25:30,816 --> 00:25:30,818
in immunology, don't you?

1303
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:33,421
I am...

1304
00:25:34,687 --> 00:25:34,689
so sorry.

1305
00:25:38,157 --> 00:25:38,159
I'm so stupid.

1306
00:25:39,224 --> 00:25:39,226
No, no,

1307
00:25:40,659 --> 00:25:40,661
no, you're not.

1308
00:25:42,027 --> 00:25:42,029
You knew this all along.

1309
00:25:45,197 --> 00:25:45,199
Yeah, that transcript youaccidentally left behind,

1310
00:25:47,299 --> 00:25:47,301
your fake boyfriend in Paris,

1311
00:25:48,668 --> 00:25:48,670
pretending you didn'tknow who Dr. Leekie was.

1312
00:25:50,503 --> 00:25:50,505
I knew it was bullshit,

1313
00:25:53,907 --> 00:25:53,909
but I still thought you were on my side.

1314
00:25:56,877 --> 00:25:56,879
I wanted to trust you.

1315
00:25:58,179 --> 00:25:58,181
You can trust me.

1316
00:26:00,515 --> 00:26:00,517
You told Leekie I know these girls!

1317
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:02,452
I had to!

1318
00:26:03,851 --> 00:26:03,853
Look at me.

1319
00:26:05,753 --> 00:26:05,755
He says you're in danger.

1320
00:26:08,489 --> 00:26:08,491
Of what?!

1321
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:11,561
You don't know, do you?

1322
00:26:14,362 --> 00:26:14,364
No.

1323
00:26:17,933 --> 00:26:20,871
Then you're the real danger, Delphine.

1324
00:26:24,105 --> 00:26:24,107
Alison, you're only making things worse.

1325
00:26:26,607 --> 00:26:37,387
I only want to talk to Felix.

1326
00:26:39,821 --> 00:26:39,823
This is all Aynsley.

1327
00:26:41,189 --> 00:26:41,191
She put them up to this.

1328
00:26:43,524 --> 00:26:43,526
It's all part of the experiment.

1329
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:45,662
Yes, how do clones react when ritually

1330
00:26:47,595 --> 00:26:47,597
humiliated by friends and loved ones?

1331
00:26:49,764 --> 00:26:49,766
Fascinating.

1332
00:26:51,665 --> 00:26:52,867
Hey!

1333
00:26:54,268 --> 00:27:03,646
Sharesies?

1334
00:27:05,512 --> 00:27:05,514
Maybe it's not just Aynsley.

1335
00:27:07,915 --> 00:27:07,917
Maybe they're all monitors.

1336
00:27:09,483 --> 00:27:09,485
The reverend seems all right.

1337
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:11,321
Actually, he's kind of sexy.

1338
00:27:12,954 --> 00:27:12,956
Man of the cloth, and all that.

1339
00:27:17,192 --> 00:27:22,967
Felix, what am I going to do?

1340
00:27:26,503 --> 00:27:26,505
Put your chin up. Be a woman.

1341
00:27:29,338 --> 00:27:30,907
This is backstabbing 101.

1342
00:27:32,308 --> 00:27:32,310
I cannot go back out there.

1343
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:34,612
Of course you can.

1344
00:27:36,646 --> 00:27:36,648
You're going to face the music,

1345
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:38,482
eat some humble pie,

1346
00:27:40,916 --> 00:27:40,918
hug it out, play opossum.

1347
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:42,252
Aynsley's going to think she's won

1348
00:27:45,387 --> 00:27:56,633
and you are going tolive to fight another day.

1349
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:57,802
Mm-hmm.

1350
00:27:58,967 --> 00:28:01,470
Oh, lord.

1351
00:28:04,005 --> 00:28:04,007
Can you help me get my face on?

1352
00:28:06,841 --> 00:28:52,734
With pleasure.

1353
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:54,736
Helena still won't answer.

1354
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:57,072
What do you plan to do,

1355
00:28:58,905 --> 00:28:58,907
turn her over to Leekie?

1356
00:29:01,107 --> 00:29:01,109
I don't know.

1357
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:02,543
I don't know what he's really

1358
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:03,978
going to do with her, do I?

1359
00:29:05,411 --> 00:29:05,413
Does that matter?

1360
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:06,914
She came after your daughter.

1361
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:11,151
Yeah, my gut says put abullet in her myself, but,

1362
00:29:13,552 --> 00:29:13,554
you don't understand what it's like.

1363
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:15,889
I look at Helena and I see me.

1364
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,892
You don't owe her anything, Sarah.

1365
00:29:23,494 --> 00:29:23,496
I, um...

1366
00:29:26,363 --> 00:29:26,365
I got in touch with mypeople back in England,

1367
00:29:27,798 --> 00:29:27,800
about where you're really from.

1368
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:29,902
And?

1369
00:29:32,636 --> 00:29:32,638
They said they'd get back to me, but,

1370
00:29:34,505 --> 00:29:34,507
they're scared,

1371
00:29:37,441 --> 00:29:40,112
as if something isgoing on over there, too.

1372
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:42,482
Please, Cosima.

1373
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:43,984
Where are you going?

1374
00:29:45,584 --> 00:29:45,586
Why, so you can tell Leekie?

1375
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:47,587
I'm such an idiot!

1376
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:49,422
What else did you tell him?

1377
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:51,224
Nothing!

1378
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:52,993
Just the seven names.

1379
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:56,762
Nothing about Kira.

1380
00:29:58,229 --> 00:29:58,231
She's an anomaly. You know that?

1381
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:01,101
Delphine, you can use me,

1382
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:02,402
that's fine,

1383
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:04,504
but don't go near that little girl.

1384
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:06,106
I didn't and I won't!

1385
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:07,140
Get out!

1386
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:09,309
Please listen to me.

1387
00:30:11,175 --> 00:30:11,177
Just let me tell you this one thing.

1388
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:14,147
Just listen to me.

1389
00:30:16,715 --> 00:30:16,717
I didn't want to fall for you.

1390
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:20,419
I wasn't supposed to.

1391
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:21,788
But I have.

1392
00:30:25,524 --> 00:30:25,526
How can I possibly believe that, Delphine?

1393
00:30:27,026 --> 00:30:27,028
Because you feel it!

1394
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:28,062
Ugh!

1395
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:30,498
This is not... it's not a lie.

1396
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:33,167
It's not possible.

1397
00:30:35,234 --> 00:30:35,236
You know, I've neverbeen with a woman before.

1398
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:49,984
Yeah, it showed.

1399
00:30:51,817 --> 00:30:51,819
The 23rd, right?

1400
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:53,587
Yeah, east platform, north end.

1401
00:30:56,255 --> 00:30:56,257
I was on the other side, fixing a derailer.

1402
00:30:58,457 --> 00:31:01,227
That's her.

1403
00:31:02,828 --> 00:31:02,830
What a shame.

1404
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:04,097
That's Beth.

1405
00:31:06,732 --> 00:31:17,777
And then this other lady walks up.

1406
00:31:19,645 --> 00:31:23,583
That'd be your jumper.

1407
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:25,452
Wait, wait. Rewind that.

1408
00:31:27,286 --> 00:31:27,288
Right... stop, right there.

1409
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:28,589
Shit.

1410
00:31:29,821 --> 00:32:03,090
I never saw it from this angle.

1411
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:04,658
Helena.

1412
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:07,427
Sarah!

1413
00:32:10,127 --> 00:32:17,542
You're the only one I can really turn to.

1414
00:32:18,909 --> 00:32:18,911
How do you know it's not a trap?

1415
00:32:20,911 --> 00:32:20,913
She was convincing.

1416
00:32:22,346 --> 00:32:22,348
It is a trap.

1417
00:32:23,781 --> 00:32:23,783
But now you know where she is,

1418
00:32:25,215 --> 00:32:25,217
just give her to Leekie.

1419
00:32:26,717 --> 00:32:26,719
I'd have to agree with him, at this point.

1420
00:32:29,186 --> 00:32:29,188
And then what? Thenwe're partners with Leekie

1421
00:32:30,618 --> 00:32:30,619
and then he's going to find out about Kira.

1422
00:32:31,198 --> 00:32:31,200
Tsk. Sarah...

1423
00:32:32,824 --> 00:32:32,825
I don't know how I'm going to play this,

1424
00:32:36,393 --> 00:32:41,867
okay? Just... just give me a minute.

1425
00:32:44,836 --> 00:32:44,838
Hey, you're awake.

1426
00:32:46,404 --> 00:32:46,406
How do you feel?

1427
00:32:47,973 --> 00:32:47,975
Tired.

1428
00:32:50,142 --> 00:32:50,144
Yeah.

1429
00:32:52,545 --> 00:32:52,547
You had a big crash,

1430
00:32:55,514 --> 00:32:55,516
but you're going to be just fine.

1431
00:32:59,050 --> 00:32:59,052
It wasn't Helena's fault.

1432
00:33:01,052 --> 00:33:01,054
What?

1433
00:33:03,254 --> 00:33:03,256
I went outside to play with her.

1434
00:33:06,757 --> 00:33:06,759
She tell you to say this?

1435
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:08,761
No.

1436
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:10,062
She's dangerous.

1437
00:33:13,029 --> 00:33:13,031
She's sick in the head andit makes her want to hurt us.

1438
00:33:15,498 --> 00:33:15,500
She just needs your help.

1439
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:17,702
I'm sorry, Kira.

1440
00:33:20,336 --> 00:33:38,957
I don't think anybody can help Helena now.

1441
00:33:41,291 --> 00:33:41,293
Alison,

1442
00:33:45,829 --> 00:33:45,831
I saw you in that van with Chad.

1443
00:33:47,631 --> 00:33:47,633
My children saw you.

1444
00:33:49,099 --> 00:33:49,101
I just wish you could understand

1445
00:33:50,533 --> 00:33:50,535
how much damage you've caused.

1446
00:33:53,803 --> 00:33:53,805
I mean, we all trusted you.

1447
00:33:55,739 --> 00:33:55,741
Aynsley,

1448
00:33:57,173 --> 00:33:57,175
you brought us here today, didn't you?

1449
00:33:59,642 --> 00:33:59,644
I care about you, sweetie.

1450
00:34:01,978 --> 00:34:01,980
You called all these people

1451
00:34:03,447 --> 00:34:03,449
and told them everything.

1452
00:34:06,183 --> 00:34:06,185
I'm doing this to help you.

1453
00:34:07,684 --> 00:34:10,289
And I thank you.

1454
00:34:12,323 --> 00:34:12,325
For scrutinizing every detail of my life

1455
00:34:15,026 --> 00:34:15,028
since the day I moved into this fishbowl.

1456
00:34:18,829 --> 00:34:18,831
You have pried and snoopedand gossiped about me

1457
00:34:21,999 --> 00:34:22,001
like I was your own,personal laboratory subject.

1458
00:34:23,801 --> 00:34:23,803
How would you like it

1459
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:26,972
if I turned your life inside out?

1460
00:34:29,764 --> 00:34:32,097
If I told all these people that Chad,your husband, slept with
the spin-class instructor,

1461
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:33,432
long before me.

1462
00:34:33,434 --> 00:34:34,834
Well maybe he acts that way

1463
00:34:34,836 --> 00:34:38,704
because you blew the roofer at the cabin!

1464
00:34:38,706 --> 00:34:40,206
Wow!

1465
00:34:40,208 --> 00:34:43,009
Okay, um... Alison, you see...

1466
00:34:43,011 --> 00:34:44,010
No!

1467
00:34:44,012 --> 00:34:46,446
No more words!

1468
00:34:46,448 --> 00:34:49,349
She's right.

1469
00:34:49,351 --> 00:34:51,351
This has gone far enough.

1470
00:34:51,353 --> 00:34:53,286
Mom, everybody, out, now!

1471
00:34:53,288 --> 00:34:55,055
Let's go.

1472
00:35:02,899 --> 00:35:07,201
This was your olivebranch and you torched it!

1473
00:35:07,203 --> 00:35:09,370
Huge mistake.

1474
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:18,646
That went very well.

1475
00:35:18,648 --> 00:35:20,214
- I think it went well.- Yeah.

1476
00:35:59,987 --> 00:36:01,020
You came.

1477
00:36:03,958 --> 00:36:05,425
How is Kira?

1478
00:36:08,262 --> 00:36:10,463
You're never going to see her again.

1479
00:36:10,465 --> 00:36:12,865
I would never hurt her.

1480
00:36:12,867 --> 00:36:16,001
I wish I could believe you.

1481
00:36:26,947 --> 00:36:29,081
Do it.

1482
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:38,823
Shit!

1483
00:36:40,493 --> 00:36:42,126
You care!

1484
00:36:42,128 --> 00:36:44,762
No, I don't.

1485
00:36:44,764 --> 00:36:46,096
Stay back!

1486
00:36:46,098 --> 00:36:47,464
Don't try any shit!

1487
00:37:05,685 --> 00:37:08,854
You are all I have now.

1488
00:37:25,539 --> 00:37:29,041
I love you.

1489
00:37:39,018 --> 00:37:40,252
You must be Sarah.

1490
00:37:40,254 --> 00:37:42,187
You can't harm her kid!

1491
00:37:42,189 --> 00:37:44,223
Harm her? No, never.

1492
00:37:44,225 --> 00:37:45,524
The child is innocent.

1493
00:37:45,526 --> 00:37:47,893
You are the light, Helena.

1494
00:37:47,895 --> 00:37:49,262
You're the original.

1495
00:37:49,264 --> 00:37:50,563
You know what that means?

1496
00:37:50,565 --> 00:37:53,799
The child is rightfully your daughter.

1497
00:37:53,801 --> 00:37:56,068
- He's lying!- Helena, Helena.

1498
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,470
There's no original.

1499
00:37:57,472 --> 00:37:59,739
I told you... we're the same.

1500
00:37:59,741 --> 00:38:01,207
Neither of us is the original.

1501
00:38:01,209 --> 00:38:02,307
Put her down!

1502
00:38:02,309 --> 00:38:06,978
We'll bring the childhome to her real mother.

1503
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,413
Helena! Helena.

1504
00:38:08,415 --> 00:38:10,014
Look, look...

1505
00:38:10,016 --> 00:38:11,816
you know that connection you feel?

1506
00:38:11,818 --> 00:38:14,552
I feel it, too.

1507
00:38:14,554 --> 00:38:17,722
It's us.

1508
00:38:17,724 --> 00:38:19,991
She'll say anything to save herself.

1509
00:38:19,993 --> 00:38:22,160
He locked you in a cage!

1510
00:38:22,162 --> 00:38:24,762
He lied to you your entire life!

1511
00:38:24,764 --> 00:38:28,366
He's going to do that to Kira.

1512
00:38:28,368 --> 00:38:31,035
He's going to hurt Kira,

1513
00:38:31,037 --> 00:38:33,471
like he hurt you.

1514
00:38:45,416 --> 00:38:47,183
You made me this way.

1515
00:38:47,185 --> 00:38:50,887
Helena.

1516
00:39:12,347 --> 00:39:14,882
I know what you are.

1517
00:39:14,884 --> 00:39:17,118
Yeah, I'm the one with the keys.

1518
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,887
Maybe I'll give 'em to Dr. Leekie.

1519
00:39:24,361 --> 00:39:25,794
Come on.

1520
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:36,039
Sarah! Sarah!

1521
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:40,535
S?

1522
00:39:40,537 --> 00:39:41,736
Sarah, where are you?

1523
00:39:41,738 --> 00:39:43,838
I'm about to give Helena to Leekie.

1524
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,339
He knows who I am. He's going to find out

1525
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,542
about Kira, sooner or later.

1526
00:39:47,544 --> 00:39:48,876
You can't.

1527
00:39:48,878 --> 00:39:50,378
You need to get back here, right away.

1528
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,679
With Helena.

1529
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:53,747
What? Why?

1530
00:39:53,749 --> 00:39:55,883
I'll explain when you get here.

1531
00:40:03,492 --> 00:40:04,525
Sarah!

1532
00:40:30,251 --> 00:40:31,918
You wanted to see me?

1533
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,120
Yeah.

1534
00:40:33,122 --> 00:40:36,156
It's about Beth Childs.

1535
00:40:41,797 --> 00:40:43,398
I'm sorry.

1536
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,067
She said she'd be here.

1537
00:40:49,938 --> 00:40:53,040
Yes.

1538
00:40:53,042 --> 00:40:54,979
They didn't show.

1539
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:00,752
Blood is thicker than you think, Aldous.

1540
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:02,921
Jesus Christ!

1541
00:41:04,987 --> 00:41:04,989
How long has Art been sitting on this?

1542
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:10,360
Just a couple of days, sir.

1543
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:12,430
Really, Angie?

1544
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:14,933
You said by the end of the day.

1545
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:17,602
We're getting an arrestwarrant for Beth Childs.

1546
00:41:21,939 --> 00:41:21,941
Lieutenant, Beth's dead.

1547
00:41:24,575 --> 00:41:29,948
You need a warrant for Sarah Manning.

1548
00:41:31,583 --> 00:41:31,585
Where's Helena?

1549
00:41:33,351 --> 00:41:33,353
I tied her up in the trunk.

1550
00:41:34,953 --> 00:41:39,558
What's going on?

1551
00:41:43,928 --> 00:41:43,930
Sarah, this is Amelia.

1552
00:41:45,096 --> 00:41:45,098
Hi.

1553
00:41:47,566 --> 00:41:47,568
Look at you.

1554
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:51,272
Sarah.

1555
00:41:54,941 --> 00:41:59,881
I'm your birth mother.

1556
00:42:04,051 --> 00:42:04,053
Yeah, I'm not what you expected, I'm sure.

1557
00:42:07,322 --> 00:42:07,324
I kind of gave up expecting.

1558
00:42:10,224 --> 00:42:10,226
I'm sorry to arrive like this, but,

1559
00:42:11,725 --> 00:42:11,727
when word came you were looking for me,

1560
00:42:13,593 --> 00:42:13,595
I had to leave cape town in a hurry.

1561
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:17,832
I was being watched, you see.

1562
00:42:21,534 --> 00:42:21,536
After all this time, they...

1563
00:42:23,669 --> 00:42:23,671
they found me again.

1564
00:42:28,106 --> 00:42:28,108
I was only 22, in a new country.

1565
00:42:30,175 --> 00:42:30,177
A wealthy couple asked me to be

1566
00:42:32,177 --> 00:42:32,179
their in-vitro surrogate.

1567
00:42:35,481 --> 00:42:35,483
They paid me, provided a flat in London,

1568
00:42:37,049 --> 00:42:37,051
a legal arrangement.

1569
00:42:40,253 --> 00:42:40,255
But something was off.

1570
00:42:41,988 --> 00:42:41,990
The medical tests were excessive

1571
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:43,492
and I overheard the couple

1572
00:42:44,558 --> 00:42:44,560
talking with the doctors,

1573
00:42:48,796 --> 00:42:48,798
about a child unfettered by tradition,

1574
00:42:51,732 --> 00:42:51,734
an advanced...

1575
00:42:54,168 --> 00:42:54,170
evolution, of some kind.

1576
00:42:55,736 --> 00:42:55,738
Neolution?

1577
00:42:59,039 --> 00:42:59,041
Yeah, but they weren't a couple at all.

1578
00:43:00,774 --> 00:43:00,776
They were scientists.

1579
00:43:04,879 --> 00:43:04,881
The child I carried wasn't meant for them.

1580
00:43:09,284 --> 00:43:09,286
I realized the lifeinside of me was in danger,

1581
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:10,721
so I ran,

1582
00:43:16,057 --> 00:43:16,059
I hid, and gave birth tothe two of you in secret.

1583
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:18,262
The two of us?

1584
00:43:22,331 --> 00:43:22,333
Yeah, I had twins.

1585
00:43:25,466 --> 00:43:25,468
I knew I couldn't keep you,

1586
00:43:26,968 --> 00:43:26,970
so I hid you away...

1587
00:43:30,238 --> 00:43:33,108
one to the state and one to the church.

1588
00:43:35,743 --> 00:43:37,580
Helena.

1589
00:43:39,247 --> 00:43:41,651
Who do you work for?

1590
00:43:43,252 --> 00:43:43,254
I need to see you privately.

1591
00:43:44,653 --> 00:43:44,655
I have something for you.

1592
00:43:45,754 --> 00:43:45,756
Mind Amelia.

1593
00:43:46,922 --> 00:43:48,992
Why?

1594
00:43:50,392 --> 00:43:50,394
I found a known associate.

1595
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:52,262
Isn't this place off-limits to you guys?

1596
00:43:54,462 --> 00:43:54,464
- Yes?- Alison!

1597
00:43:56,097 --> 00:43:57,766
Cosima!

1598
00:43:59,233 --> 00:43:59,235
Sarah Manning!
