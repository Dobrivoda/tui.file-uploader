베스가 그를 감시하고있었던거 같에

6
00:00:15,061 --> 00:00:17,195
지금이 폴이 일하는 곳을확인해봐야 할 때인가봐

7
00:00:17,197 --> 00:00:18,830
베스 일로얘기 좀 해야겠네

8
00:00:18,832 --> 00:00:20,832
감시자로서간섭하면 안된다는

9
00:00:20,834 --> 00:00:22,166
자네 역할을이해하도록 하게

10
00:00:22,168 --> 00:00:24,335
폴이 날 쫓아서키아라를 봤어

11
00:00:24,337 --> 00:00:26,237
너도 미생물학 맞지?

12
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:27,238
델피네야

13
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,239

나도 좀 사생활이있어야지

18
00:00:35,882 --> 00:00:37,415
앨리슨, 그만 못해!

사라, 난 니가죽은 줄 알았어! 아-아!

돈 갖다 드릴께요형님, 아-아!

25
00:00:49,729 --> 00:00:51,029
파우치가내 손가락을 가져갔지

26
00:00:51,031 --> 00:00:53,498
저 돈 원해?당장 챙겨 나가

27
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,565
베스는 어딨지?

28
00:00:54,567 --> 00:00:55,967
그 애 자살했어

29
00:00:55,969 --> 00:00:57,268
내가 그 애 신분을챙겼지

30
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,237
너가 걔 감시자잖아아니야? 의사들이 와서

31
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:01,773
그 애가 잠든 동안의학 실험을 했지

32
00:01:01,775 --> 00:01:03,041
왜인지만 말해줘

33
00:01:03,043 --> 00:01:04,542
우리한텐 왜인지말 안해주거든

34
00:02:31,463 --> 00:02:32,964
말도안돼!이런!

35
00:02:36,535 --> 00:02:38,803
이걸 다 내가해야되는거야?

36
00:02:40,806 --> 00:02:42,673
세시간 남았는데여지껏

37
00:02:42,675 --> 00:02:43,975
설거지도 안했고

38
00:02:43,977 --> 00:02:45,943
음료수 통도안채워져 있고

39
00:02:45,945 --> 00:02:48,146
애들 선물 봉지들도정리되있지 않고

40
00:02:48,148 --> 00:02:50,815

일정 맞춰야지이것봐

44
00:02:55,221 --> 00:02:56,554
우리 서둘러야 겠어

45
00:02:56,556 --> 00:02:58,990
한밤중에 어디갔었던거야, 도니?

나 깼는데당신 침대에 없더라

48
00:03:02,536 --> 00:03:03,963
여보, 우리이럴 시간 없거든

49
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,031
애들이 밖에서뭘하고 있는지도 모르겠는데

50
00:03:06,151 --> 00:03:08,466
해야될 일은 백만가지고당신은 도움도 안되고!

51
00:03:08,468 --> 00:03:10,001
우리가 필요한거목록이나 적어놔

58
00:03:19,512 --> 00:03:20,568
나가서 당신이어제 가져다 놓기로

00:03:20,688 --> 00:03:22,197
했었던 것들을가져와야지!

60

00:04:18,438 --> 00:04:20,004
군에 있을 때시작된게 아니야

69
00:04:20,006 --> 00:04:22,673
군복을 벗고부터시작됐지

70
00:04:22,675 --> 00:04:25,142
개별 계약직으로일하면서

71
00:04:25,144 --> 00:04:29,180
이해가?

72
00:04:29,182 --> 00:04:31,115
이런거 원해서했던건 아니야

영향력 같은게

77
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,826
어떤지 알잖아그치?

바로 이 조리대 위에서뒹굴었다는거지

81
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:50,167
근데 넌너 자신도 아니였잖아

82
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:52,069
또 너도너 자신은 아니였지

83
00:04:52,071 --> 00:04:53,904
넌 이 일이 얼마나심각한건지 이해하지

84
00:04:53,906 --> 00:04:55,673
못하고 있는거 같은데

85
00:04:55,675 --> 00:04:57,341

00:04:57,343 --> 00:05:00,778

의학 실험에 결과는어떻게 됐어?

90
00:05:05,985 --> 00:05:08,119
난 널 거기서빼내고 싶었었어

91
00:05:08,121 --> 00:05:09,654
리오 가는거진심이였거든

92
00:05:09,656 --> 00:05:11,989
실험 결과가 어떻게됐는지만 말해줄레?

93
00:05:11,991 --> 00:05:13,424
올리비에에게들어가

94

그래도 괜찮지?

99
00:05:29,841 --> 00:05:31,842
그럼 실험 결과에내가 베스가

아니라고나왔있을꺼 같에?

101
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,279
그 실험이 뭐하는 건지는나도 몰라

102
00:05:35,281 --> 00:05:38,201

니가 나에 대해신경쓰는게 뭔데?

106
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:45,056
그게 뭐던간에 나한테얘기하진 않을꺼잖아

107
00:05:49,394 --> 00:05:50,394

그치?이중 눈속임이라고..

111
00:06:07,814 --> 00:06:09,447
감시자는 실험의

112
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:10,948
목적에 대해알지 못한다고

113
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,817
그런식이여야 결과에영향을 못미치거든

114
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:14,885
아, 안녕어쨌거나 나와야 했어

115
00:06:14,887 --> 00:06:17,388
지금은 내가어디 가는지도 모르겠다

116
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,823
그렇겠다저기, 나도

117
00:06:18,825 --> 00:06:21,225
감시자 딜레마가있거든

이번 학기는나도 여기가 처음이라

119
00:06:24,464 --> 00:06:26,097
나랑 어울리는사람이 없었는데

120
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:29,333
누가 친구가 되고싶어하거든

121
00:06:29,335 --> 00:06:31,902
사람들한테떨어져있어, 코즈

122
00:06:31,904 --> 00:06:33,404
과학에만매달려있어, 알았어?

123
00:06:33,406 --> 00:06:35,373
과학에만매달려있으라고?

124
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,408
지금, 내가 뭔데괴짜 원숭이?

125
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,844
심각하다고! 폴이나쁜 자식이란 말야. 알았어?

126
00:06:39,846 --> 00:06:41,312
전직 군인이야

127
00:06:41,314 --> 00:06:42,680
누군가 너와 가까워지려고한다면은

128
00:06:42,682 --> 00:06:44,014
떨어져 있어야해

129
00:06:44,016 --> 00:06:46,751
맞다, 옛말대로 "내 말대로만 해내가 하는대로 하진 마"네?

130
00:06:46,753 --> 00:06:48,085
미안..

131
00:06:48,087 --> 00:06:49,453
저기, 앨리슨이전화한다

132
00:06:49,455 --> 00:06:50,588

나 좀 도와줘

136
00:06:58,364 --> 00:07:00,464
무슨 일 있어?

137
00:07:00,466 --> 00:07:01,866
음, 상황이 좀 생겼어

138
00:07:01,868 --> 00:07:03,334
어떤 상황인데?

139
00:07:03,336 --> 00:07:06,205
그냥 이쪽으로 와지금 바로

140
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:07,638
머야 불공평해!

141
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,614
어, 그럼 내가너 또 잡은거다, 하!

142
00:07:09,615 --> 00:07:11,675
그만, 그만, 너동생이랑 앤슬리네 집에

143
00:07:11,677 --> 00:07:13,155

00:07:13,275 --> 00:07:14,028
그래도, 엄마!

그래, 아주 재밌을꺼다!

146
00:07:15,314 --> 00:07:17,214
싫어요! / 가! 아줌마한테다 됐다고 얘기해

147
00:07:57,829 --> 00:07:59,976
어디로 뜨시려고사라?

148
00:08:15,407 --> 00:08:16,807
앨리슨?

149
00:08:19,377 --> 00:08:20,978
내가 왜 의자에묶여있는거지?

150
00:08:22,215 --> 00:08:24,582
상자에 뭐가 있었는지솔직히 말해, 도니

151
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:25,877
뭐?

152
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,952
당신의 특별한 상자

153
00:08:27,954 --> 00:08:29,453
그 안에 뭐가있었냐고?

154
00:08:29,455 --> 00:08:31,088
당신 정신 나갔어?

155
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,189
풀어줘

156
00:08:32,191 --> 00:08:33,290
안돼!

157
00:08:33,292 --> 00:08:34,758
도니, 이 질문에

158
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,494
꼭 대답을들어야겠어

159
00:08:36,496 --> 00:08:39,296
왜 그래, 앨리슨무슨 미친 짓이야!

160
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,834

괜찮을 꺼야

162
00:08:45,321 --> 00:08:47,039
당신이 늘 나한테하는 말 아니던가?

163
00:08:52,777 --> 00:08:55,279
당신이 정말로털어놓고

164
00:08:55,281 --> 00:08:57,681
싶은게 뭔지떠올려봐

165
00:08:57,683 --> 00:08:58,849
아니면 뭐..

166
00:08:58,851 --> 00:09:01,252
내 몸에 빤짝이라도붙여주려고?

167
00:09:01,254 --> 00:09:02,486
서류 옮겼잖아

168
00:09:02,488 --> 00:09:04,321
서류?무슨 서류?

169
00:09:04,323 --> 00:09:06,490
나에 대해 기록한서류 말야

170
00:09:06,492 --> 00:09:08,492
당신 상자에 있던당신의 특별한 상자

171
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:16,367
당신 정신 나갔어?!

172
00:09:16,369 --> 00:09:18,068
당신이 한 짓 알아도니!

173
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,069

00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:29,238
곧바로 어두운 면을드러내더군요, 올리비에 씨

335
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:32,413
어제 밤에 그녀가약 복용하는걸 중단시켰습니다

336
00:16:32,457 --> 00:16:34,403
경찰도 그만뒀고상담도 때려쳤죠

337
00:16:34,404 --> 00:16:35,591
주변에 아무도없습니다

338
00:16:35,592 --> 00:16:36,970
자네가 있지

339
00:16:36,971 --> 00:16:39,875
다른 때처럼 이런 어려움을나눌 수 있지

340
00:16:40,731 --> 00:16:42,999
정말 중요하지 않으면간섭하지 말게나

341
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,079
그녀가 또다시 이러면제 탓으로

342
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,996
돌리시지 않을지알아야겠습니다

343
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,757

00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:02,104
다른 결론을내리지는 않을껄세

347
00:17:02,337 --> 00:17:03,614
됐나?

348
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,276
그럼 임무로돌아가게

349
00:17:15,672 --> 00:17:17,213
나도 알아, 도니

350
00:17:17,257 --> 00:17:20,494
그러니 어떻게 된건지말해도 괜찮아

351
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,391
뭐가 어떻게 되는데?

352
00:17:22,393 --> 00:17:25,527
이중 눈속임이나감시하는거나

353
00:17:25,529 --> 00:17:28,472
앨리슨, 너 자신이무슨 말 하는지 알어?

354
00:17:28,999 --> 00:17:30,718
내가 한밤 중에일어난건

355
00:17:30,762 --> 00:17:32,304
크리켓 본거야!

356
00:17:32,503 --> 00:17:33,836
크리켓?

357
00:17:34,058 --> 00:17:37,306
남아프리카 경기는새벽 4시에 시작한다고

358
00:17:37,308 --> 00:17:39,374
내 생활에서당신한테

359
00:17:39,376 --> 00:17:40,743
확인받지 않은게있기나 한거야?

360
00:17:40,745 --> 00:17:43,412
당장 빌어먹을눈가리개나 풀어!

동네 사람들전부 와있는거야?

362
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:49,923
당신 머리 속에도대체 얼마나

363
00:17:49,924 --> 00:17:52,433
말도 안되는게들어있는거야?

364
00:17:52,434 --> 00:17:53,922
어이, 말 조심해도니!

365
00:17:53,924 --> 00:17:56,091
앨리슨당신 생리통에

366
00:17:56,093 --> 00:17:57,526
정신 나간거 아니야?!

367
00:17:57,528 --> 00:17:59,495
어이!말 조심하라고!

368
00:17:59,497 --> 00:18:01,997
니 마누라가 이 가정을지탱하는거라고!

369
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:03,432
좋은 말씀은그만 하시지!

370
00:18:03,434 --> 00:18:04,733
알아 들어?!

371
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:06,702
네

372
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,188
코지마!

373
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:10,509
왔구나

374
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,434
그래

375
00:18:11,435 --> 00:18:12,674
와줘서 정말 고마워

376
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:14,109
절대 실망 안할꺼야

377
00:18:14,883 --> 00:18:16,821
그래, 그렇겠다

378
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:18,683
그래, 리키 박사는다양한 사상에 대해

379
00:18:18,684 --> 00:18:20,883
관심이 많거든이리와

380
00:18:20,885 --> 00:18:22,169
그래

381
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:30,296
신진화..

382
00:18:30,362 --> 00:18:34,129
내일을 위한오늘의 철학이며

383
00:18:34,131 --> 00:18:35,564
과거에 뿌리를 둔

384
00:18:35,566 --> 00:18:38,670
인간이란 유기체의진화입니다

385
00:18:39,617 --> 00:18:41,906
하지만, 우리가미래를 둘러보기 전에

386
00:18:41,907 --> 00:18:44,940
여러분을 3000년 전으로안내해 드리죠

387
00:18:44,942 --> 00:18:46,775
위대한 그리스 철학자플라토의

388
00:18:46,777 --> 00:18:50,379
황혼기로 말입니다

389
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,482
늙고 초라해진 플라토는눈이 멀어가고..

390
00:18:54,552 --> 00:18:55,984
다리를 절었으며

391
00:18:55,986 --> 00:18:59,521
귀가 멀어져갔습니다!

392
00:18:59,523 --> 00:19:02,291
이제, 상상해 보시죠만약 우리가

393
00:19:02,293 --> 00:19:04,660
그의 시력을 고쳐주고귀를 듣게 해주며

394
00:19:04,662 --> 00:19:06,962
아픈 부분을티타늄 부품으로

395
00:19:06,964 --> 00:19:10,365
교체해 줄 수 있다는걸알았다면

396
00:19:10,367 --> 00:19:13,001
플라토는 우리를 신이라여겼을 것입니다!

397
00:19:13,003 --> 00:19:17,272
하지만 아니죠. 우리는 그저근본적으로 결함을 가진

398
00:19:17,274 --> 00:19:19,149
인간일 뿐입니다

399
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:24,112
당신의 안경이

400
00:19:24,114 --> 00:19:26,782
예를 들자면요당신을 어떻게 좀..

401
00:19:26,784 --> 00:19:28,016
음

402
00:19:28,018 --> 00:19:29,117
플라토닉하게보이게 해주죠

403
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:30,586
하지만 아주 가까운미래에는

404
00:19:30,588 --> 00:19:33,288
당신이 안경을 벗은 채로는이전에 결코

405
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:35,090
볼 수 없었던 빛을

406
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:38,260
볼 수 있는 능력을선사해드릴 수 있습니다..

407
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:40,195
적외선, X선

408
00:19:40,197 --> 00:19:43,332
자외선까지흥미롭지 않으세요?

409
00:19:43,334 --> 00:19:45,925
그냥 간단히 라식 수술부터해볼지도요

410
00:19:47,538 --> 00:19:48,971
그렇게 해도 좋고요

411
00:19:48,973 --> 00:19:51,506
바로 진화적인 선택을하는거죠

412
00:19:51,508 --> 00:19:54,276
신진화는 우리에게자기유도적인 진화의

413
00:19:54,278 --> 00:19:57,012
기회를 제공하며또한 저는

414
00:19:57,014 --> 00:19:59,948
그것이 단 하나의선택이 아니라

415
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:03,941
인간의 권리라믿습니다

416
00:20:38,421 --> 00:20:41,356
오, 필릭스필릭스, 필릭스

417
00:20:46,095 --> 00:20:48,497
다 왔다, 필릭스

418
00:20:48,499 --> 00:20:50,899
파티와 함께파티할 시간이지

419
00:20:59,677 --> 00:21:00,943
오, 젠장

420
00:21:00,945 --> 00:21:03,773

00:21:03,774 --> 00:21:05,513
너 거울이나봐봤어?

422
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,186
머리 위에뭐가 있다

423
00:21:07,187 --> 00:21:10,886
망할, 사람들 말대로완전히 옆길로 샌거지, 피

크래커좀 더 있냐고?

428
00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:21,730
내가 알아야 되는거야범생언니?

그래, 그럼 뭔데?이상주의인가?

490
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:11,870

내가 방금..너 여기 날라온거야?

788
00:39:03,963 --> 00:39:05,230

789
00:39:05,232 --> 00:39:07,298
방금 문자그대로널 침대에 눞혔거든

790
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,935
깨.. 깼거든

791
00:39:10,937 --> 00:39:13,104
오, 저희 아직인사도 안했죠

792
00:39:13,106 --> 00:39:15,740
전 길건너 사는앤슬리에요

793
00:39:15,742 --> 00:39:17,242
당신은?

794
00:39:17,244 --> 00:39:19,844
그냥 들렸어요

795
00:39:19,846 --> 00:39:21,346
음

796
00:39:21,348 --> 00:39:23,047
내가 말했듯이

797
00:39:23,049 --> 00:39:24,916
결혼이란게 전부

798
00:39:24,918 --> 00:39:26,684
조금씩 비밀이있잖아

799
00:39:26,686 --> 00:39:28,820
이런건 성인끼리

800
00:39:28,822 --> 00:39:30,688
일이잖아

801
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:32,790
다치는 사람도없고

802
00:39:32,792 --> 00:39:37,328
음, 그거 있잖아?네가 맞다

803
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:39,597
내가 상관할 바가아니지

804
00:39:53,979 --> 00:39:55,480
집에 갈 시간이네

805
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:23,908
도니

806
00:40:24,351 --> 00:40:27,745
아까 내가 좀음, 이성을 잃은거..

807
00:40:27,747 --> 00:40:32,517
아냐, 아니, 아니 아니내 잘못이야

808
00:40:33,245 --> 00:40:35,453
당신이 맞아..

809
00:40:35,455 --> 00:40:37,655
당신이 우리 가정을지탱하고 있는거야

810
00:40:40,526 --> 00:40:42,760
정말 미안해

811
00:40:42,762 --> 00:40:44,729
당연히 당신도알겠지만

812
00:40:44,731 --> 00:40:49,901
내 특별 상자에포르노 때문이 아니지

813
00:40:49,903 --> 00:40:52,770
당신 지니 뉴스밤기억나?

814
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,206
대학때?

815
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,411
어떻게 말해야할지모르겠어

816
00:41:00,413 --> 00:41:02,413
어쨌든 그녀하고 한번바람을 피웠어

817
00:41:02,415 --> 00:41:04,282
좋아, 두번

818
00:41:04,284 --> 00:41:07,352
그래도 당신이랑 내가깨졌던 시절이야

819
00:41:07,354 --> 00:41:09,587
그 후에도우리가 몇년 동안

820
00:41:09,589 --> 00:41:12,256
편지를 나눴거든..

821
00:41:12,258 --> 00:41:14,175
대부분은지저분한 얘기지..

822
00:41:14,176 --> 00:41:15,426
쯧

823
00:41:15,428 --> 00:41:17,629
그러다, 그녀가루푸스에 걸렸고

824
00:41:17,631 --> 00:41:20,898
다시는 소식을듣지 못했어

825
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,693
루푸스 걸렸다고?

826
00:41:24,236 --> 00:41:29,207
어떻게 됐는지는나도 몰라

827
00:41:29,209 --> 00:41:30,274
정말 미안해난 단지 뭔가

828
00:41:30,276 --> 00:41:31,776
개인적인게있었으면

829
00:41:31,778 --> 00:41:35,580
했던거야뭔가..

830
00:41:35,582 --> 00:41:37,827
잘못했어

831
00:41:46,892 --> 00:41:48,599
마실레?

832
00:41:48,621 --> 00:41:50,595
그래

833
00:41:53,899 --> 00:41:54,899
말해봐

834
00:42:01,074 --> 00:42:02,879
복제인간

835
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,837
복제인간?

836
00:42:11,476 --> 00:42:13,302
머, 우린 복제-하는말을 안쓰려고 하는데

837
00:42:13,303 --> 00:42:15,351
앨리슨이정한거지

838
00:42:16,423 --> 00:42:19,246
하지만, 그래, 우린유전적으로 동일해

839
00:42:19,247 --> 00:42:21,092
세쌍둥이가아니라

840
00:42:21,094 --> 00:42:23,127
유전적동일체라고?

841
00:42:23,129 --> 00:42:25,863
그래, 지금까지9명이 있어

842
00:42:30,836 --> 00:42:32,670
그게 당신 일이야폴

843
00:42:32,672 --> 00:42:36,040
그래서 당신이베스를 지켜보던거였지

844
00:42:36,042 --> 00:42:39,143
당신은 복제인간을감시하는거야

845
00:42:39,145 --> 00:42:40,812
그런건처음 만났을 때

846
00:42:40,814 --> 00:42:43,047
얘기 했어야지

847
00:00:04,984 --> 00:00:06,384
We're clones.

848
00:00:06,386 --> 00:00:08,519
We're someone's experimentand they're killing us off!

849
00:00:08,521 --> 00:00:11,389
We're like lab ratsin an illegal experiment.

850
00:00:11,391 --> 00:00:12,790
Sarah, where was Paulduring all this?

851
00:00:12,792 --> 00:00:15,059
We think Bethwas spying on him.

852
00:00:15,061 --> 00:00:17,195
Maybe it's time to checkout where Paul works.

853
00:00:17,197 --> 00:00:18,830
We need to talkabout Beth.

854
00:00:18,832 --> 00:00:20,832
You understandyour role as monitor

855
00:00:20,834 --> 00:00:22,166
is not to interfere.

856
00:00:22,168 --> 00:00:24,335
Paul followed mestraight to Kira.

857
00:00:24,337 --> 00:00:26,237
You're inmicrobiology, too?

858
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:27,238
Delphine.

859
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,239
Cosima.

860
00:00:28,241 --> 00:00:29,540
Enchante.

861
00:00:29,542 --> 00:00:32,143
I may be sleepingwith my spy as well.

862
00:00:32,145 --> 00:00:33,644
Donnie, what'sin the box?!

863
00:00:33,646 --> 00:00:35,880
I'm entitledto a little privacy.

864
00:00:35,882 --> 00:00:37,415
Alison, stop it!

865
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,151
"Big Boob Blowies"?!

866
00:00:40,153 --> 00:00:41,819
If anything else comesup, I'll let you know.

867
00:00:41,821 --> 00:00:43,154
Surveillance,please.

868
00:00:43,156 --> 00:00:45,123
They call it"the nanny cam".

869
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:47,658
Sarah, I thought youwere dead! Aaah!

870
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,727
I'll get you yourmoney, man. Aaah!

871
00:00:49,729 --> 00:00:51,029
Pouchytook my finger.

872
00:00:51,031 --> 00:00:53,498
You want that money?Take it and go, now.

873
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,565
Where is Beth?

874
00:00:54,567 --> 00:00:55,967
She killed herself.

875
00:00:55,969 --> 00:00:57,268
I tookher identity.

876
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,237
You're her monitor,aren't you? Doctors came

877
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:01,773
and medically examinedher in her sleep.

878
00:01:01,775 --> 00:01:03,041
Just tell me why.

879
00:01:03,043 --> 00:01:04,542
They don'ttell us why.

880
00:02:31,463 --> 00:02:32,964
Ridiculous! God!

881
00:02:36,535 --> 00:02:38,803
I got to do everythingaround here?

882
00:02:40,806 --> 00:02:42,673
Three hours to go,and the dishes

883
00:02:42,675 --> 00:02:43,975
still haven'tbeen washed,

884
00:02:43,977 --> 00:02:45,943
the drink cart hasn'tbeen loaded up,

885
00:02:45,945 --> 00:02:48,146
the kids' gift bagshaven't been sorted,

886
00:02:48,148 --> 00:02:50,815
and did we evenget ice?

887
00:02:50,817 --> 00:02:52,683
Hello,did we get ice?

888
00:02:52,685 --> 00:02:53,818
Alison, come on!

889
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,219
Get with theprogram, here.

890
00:02:55,221 --> 00:02:56,554
We needto get moving.

891
00:02:56,556 --> 00:02:58,990
Where did you go in the middleof the night, Donnie?

892
00:02:58,992 --> 00:03:00,658
Uh, I don't know,Never Never Land?

893
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,416
I woke up.You weren't in bed.

894
00:03:02,536 --> 00:03:03,963
Honey, we don't havetime for this.

895
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,031
The kids are outside,doing God knows what,

896
00:03:06,151 --> 00:03:08,466
we got a million things to do,and you're not helping!

897
00:03:08,468 --> 00:03:10,001
Just make a listof what we need

898
00:03:10,003 --> 00:03:12,036
and I'll do it when I'mout getting the damn ice.

899
00:03:12,038 --> 00:03:13,404
I need to know whereyou went, Donnie.

900
00:03:13,406 --> 00:03:14,939
Look, I know we hada bad day yesterday.

901
00:03:14,941 --> 00:03:16,707
A bad day?

902
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:18,142
Is thatwhat you call it?

903
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,510
Where are you going?

904
00:03:19,512 --> 00:03:20,568
I'm going outto get the stuff

905
00:03:20,688 --> 00:03:22,197
that you were supposedto get yesterday!

906
00:03:25,951 --> 00:03:27,952
I'm trying to have

907
00:03:27,954 --> 00:03:29,320
a conversationwith you, Donnie.

908
00:03:29,322 --> 00:03:30,988
And, oh,what a joy it is.

909
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,690
Don't worry, honey,I'm sure we'll talk

910
00:03:32,692 --> 00:03:34,892
about is later.It's all good.

911
00:03:34,894 --> 00:03:36,360
Uh.

912
00:03:40,315 --> 00:03:44,206
Orphan Black 01x06Variations Under Domestication
Original Air Date May 4, 2013

913
00:04:17,135 --> 00:04:18,436
My problems

914
00:04:18,438 --> 00:04:20,004
didn't startin the military.

915
00:04:20,006 --> 00:04:22,673
They startedout of uniform,

916
00:04:22,675 --> 00:04:25,142
as a privatecontractor.

917
00:04:25,144 --> 00:04:29,180
Understand?

918
00:04:29,182 --> 00:04:31,115
I'm not doing anyof this by choice.

919
00:04:31,117 --> 00:04:33,651
Right, so, they forced youto be Beth's monitor

920
00:04:33,653 --> 00:04:37,688
for two years, withoutever knowing why.

921
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:38,956
You're some kindof hustler.

922
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,358
You understand

923
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,826
leverage, right?

924
00:04:41,828 --> 00:04:44,495
The difference is,you chose

925
00:04:44,497 --> 00:04:47,064
to infiltrate Beth'slife, to screw

926
00:04:47,066 --> 00:04:48,399
her boyfriend,right on this counter.

927
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:50,167
And you weren'teven you.

928
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:52,069
And you weren'tyou, either.

929
00:04:52,071 --> 00:04:53,904
I don't thinkyou understand

930
00:04:53,906 --> 00:04:55,673
how serious this is.

931
00:04:55,675 --> 00:04:57,341
We need to tryand be honest

932
00:04:57,343 --> 00:05:00,778
with each other,twin sister.

933
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,146
Okay.

934
00:05:02,148 --> 00:05:03,681
So what happensto the results

935
00:05:03,683 --> 00:05:05,983
of the medical testsyou performed on me?

936
00:05:05,985 --> 00:05:08,119
I wanted to get youaway from that.

937
00:05:08,121 --> 00:05:09,654
I was seriousabout Rio.

938
00:05:09,656 --> 00:05:11,989
Just tell me, whathappens to the results?

939
00:05:11,991 --> 00:05:13,424
They go to Olivier.

940
00:05:13,426 --> 00:05:15,293
From there,I don't know.

941
00:05:20,032 --> 00:05:22,333
What are you doing?

942
00:05:22,335 --> 00:05:23,834
I'm going to takea shower,

943
00:05:23,836 --> 00:05:25,569
wash off the filth.

944
00:05:25,571 --> 00:05:27,004
Is that okaywith you?

945
00:05:29,841 --> 00:05:31,842
So do you thinkthe results

946
00:05:31,844 --> 00:05:33,778
might tell themI'm not Beth?

947
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,279
I don't know whatthe tests are for.

948
00:05:35,281 --> 00:05:37,548
I explained that.This is my world, Sarah.

949
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,116
It is you thatI'm worried about.

950
00:05:39,118 --> 00:05:41,585
Yeah?

951
00:05:41,587 --> 00:05:43,287
What is it thatworries you about me?

952
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:45,056
Whatever it is you'renot telling me.

953
00:05:49,394 --> 00:05:50,394
Sarah.

954
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,641
Hey, Cosima,you were right...

955
00:06:03,643 --> 00:06:05,976
Paul doesn't evenknow about clones.

956
00:06:05,978 --> 00:06:07,812
See? It'sa double blind...

957
00:06:07,814 --> 00:06:09,447
The monitor's unaware

958
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:10,948
of the purposeof the experiment.

959
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,817
That way, they can'tskew the results.

960
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:14,885
- Oh, hey.- I just had to get out of there.

961
00:06:14,887 --> 00:06:17,388
I don't even knowwhere I'm going.

962
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,823
Right,well, I may have

963
00:06:18,825 --> 00:06:21,225
a monitor dilemmaof my own.

964
00:06:21,227 --> 00:06:24,462
I'm new herethis semester.

965
00:06:24,464 --> 00:06:26,097
I didn't bringanybody with me,

966
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:29,333
but someone wantsto be friends.

967
00:06:29,335 --> 00:06:31,902
Just stay awayfrom them, Cos.

968
00:06:31,904 --> 00:06:33,404
Stick to the science, yeah?

969
00:06:33,406 --> 00:06:35,373
"Stick to the science"?

970
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,408
What am I,the geek monkey, now?

971
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,844
Seriously! Paul'sa bad arse, okay?

972
00:06:39,846 --> 00:06:41,312
He's ex-military.

973
00:06:41,314 --> 00:06:42,680
If somebody's tryingto get close to you,

974
00:06:42,682 --> 00:06:44,014
just stay away.

975
00:06:44,016 --> 00:06:46,751
Right, the old "Do asI say, not as I do"?

976
00:06:46,753 --> 00:06:48,085
Sorry.

977
00:06:48,087 --> 00:06:49,453
Look, Alison'scalling through.

978
00:06:49,455 --> 00:06:50,588
Are we good?

979
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:53,624
Sure.

980
00:06:55,361 --> 00:06:56,894
Hey.

981
00:06:56,896 --> 00:06:58,362
I need you.

982
00:06:58,364 --> 00:07:00,464
What's going on?

983
00:07:00,466 --> 00:07:01,866
Um, I havea situation.

984
00:07:01,868 --> 00:07:03,334
What kind of situation?

985
00:07:03,336 --> 00:07:05,636
Just get over hereright now.

986
00:07:05,638 --> 00:07:07,638
You're it! Hey, that's not fair!

987
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,407
Oh, then I'llget you again. Ha!

988
00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:11,675
Okay, okay, you'regoing to walk your sister

989
00:07:11,677 --> 00:07:13,155
to Aynsley's house and you'regoing to stay there.

990
00:07:13,275 --> 00:07:14,028
But, mom!

991
00:07:14,148 --> 00:07:15,312
Yes, it'sgoing to be fun!

992
00:07:15,314 --> 00:07:17,214
No! Go! Tell her Isaid it's okay.

993
00:07:28,527 --> 00:07:30,194
Aah! Ooh.

994
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,256
Where are youoff to, Sarah?

995
00:08:09,901 --> 00:08:10,901
Uh.

996
00:08:15,407 --> 00:08:16,807
Alison?

997
00:08:19,377 --> 00:08:20,978
Why am I tiedto the chair?

998
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,213
Shh! Shh!

999
00:08:22,215 --> 00:08:24,582
Tell me what was reallyin the box, Donnie.

1000
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:26,317
What?

1001
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,952
Your special box.

1002
00:08:27,954 --> 00:08:29,453
What wasinside of it?

1003
00:08:29,455 --> 00:08:31,088
Are you outof your mind?

1004
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,189
Untie me.

1005
00:08:32,191 --> 00:08:33,290
No!

1006
00:08:33,292 --> 00:08:34,758
Donnie, I have

1007
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,494
questions thatneed answers.

1008
00:08:36,496 --> 00:08:39,296
Come on, Alison,is is insane!

1009
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,833
Don't worry, honey.

1010
00:08:42,835 --> 00:08:44,835
It's all good.

1011
00:08:44,837 --> 00:08:46,871
Isn't that whatyou always tell me?

1012
00:08:52,777 --> 00:08:55,279
Think aboutwhat you really want

1013
00:08:55,281 --> 00:08:57,681
to get off your chest.

1014
00:08:57,683 --> 00:08:58,849
Or what,

1015
00:08:58,851 --> 00:09:01,252
you're going to sticksequins on me?

1016
00:09:01,254 --> 00:09:02,486
You moved the files.

1017
00:09:02,488 --> 00:09:04,321
- Files?- What files?

1018
00:09:04,323 --> 00:09:06,490
Your filesthat you have on me.

1019
00:09:06,492 --> 00:09:08,492
From your box.Your special box.

1020
00:09:08,494 --> 00:09:10,227
Aaah!

1021
00:09:10,229 --> 00:09:11,762
Aaah!

1022
00:09:11,764 --> 00:09:13,497
Ohhh!Oh ohh!

1023
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:16,367
Have you lostyour mind?!

1024
00:09:16,369 --> 00:09:18,068
I know what you do,Donnie!

1025
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,069
What?What do I do?

1026
00:09:19,071 --> 00:09:21,472
You spy. You performmedical examinations

1027
00:09:21,474 --> 00:09:23,007
- on me in my sleep...- What?!

1028
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:25,809
You turned my whole life intoa big, embarrassing lie;

1029
00:09:25,811 --> 00:09:27,478
and you switchedthe files

1030
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,446
in your special boxfor porno DVDs

1031
00:09:29,448 --> 00:09:32,116
of "Big BoobBlowies"!

1032
00:09:32,118 --> 00:09:33,684
Ohohoh!Please, no.

1033
00:09:33,686 --> 00:09:34,752
Ahhahaha!

1034
00:09:52,804 --> 00:09:54,061
Hey, Delphine.

1035
00:09:54,181 --> 00:09:56,507
Hey. Bonjour,Cosima.

1036
00:09:56,509 --> 00:09:58,208
I'm bored.

1037
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:59,710
Well, you know,there's this

1038
00:09:59,712 --> 00:10:02,279
lecture today thatI was going to see.

1039
00:10:02,281 --> 00:10:04,515
Wait, where is it?I was going to,

1040
00:10:04,517 --> 00:10:06,016
if you wantto come with me.

1041
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:10,621
Neolutionism,

1042
00:10:10,623 --> 00:10:12,222
really?

1043
00:10:12,224 --> 00:10:13,958
You've...you've heard of it?

1044
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,893
Yeah, it's kind of fringe,don't you think?

1045
00:10:15,895 --> 00:10:17,394
Well I think that,

1046
00:10:17,396 --> 00:10:19,730
as a Darwinist,it would interest you

1047
00:10:19,732 --> 00:10:21,265
and this Dr. Leekie

1048
00:10:21,267 --> 00:10:23,934
is a really, reallyinteresting speaker.

1049
00:10:23,936 --> 00:10:27,237
I saw his Ted talkonline and... phew.

1050
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:29,206
Hmm.

1051
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:32,710
So?

1052
00:10:32,712 --> 00:10:36,714
Sure. Why not?

1053
00:10:42,622 --> 00:10:44,021
Sarah,I can understand

1054
00:10:44,023 --> 00:10:47,491
why you took off thismorning, but I need...

1055
00:10:47,493 --> 00:10:48,926
we need to know

1056
00:10:48,928 --> 00:10:50,661
that the groundbeneath us is solid.

1057
00:10:50,663 --> 00:10:52,863

00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,721
Oh.

1241
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:31,026
Neolution...

1242
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:34,129
A philosophy of todayfor tomorrow,

1243
00:18:34,131 --> 00:18:35,564
rooted in our past,

1244
00:18:35,566 --> 00:18:38,734
in the evolutionof the human organism.

1245
00:18:38,736 --> 00:18:41,537
But before we goto the future,

1246
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:44,940
let me take you back3,000 years,

1247
00:18:44,942 --> 00:18:46,775
to the great Greekphilosopher Plato

1248
00:18:46,777 --> 00:18:49,812
and histwilight years.

1249
00:18:49,814 --> 00:18:53,482
Poor old Platowas going blind...

1250
00:18:54,552 --> 00:18:55,984
Going lame,

1251
00:18:55,986 --> 00:18:59,521
and losinghis hearing!

1252
00:18:59,523 --> 00:19:02,291
Now, imagineif he knew

1253
00:19:02,293 --> 00:19:04,660
we could correcthis sight,

1254
00:19:04,662 --> 00:19:06,962
restore his hearing,and replace

1255
00:19:06,964 --> 00:19:10,365
his ailing body partswith titanium ones.

1256
00:19:10,367 --> 00:19:13,001
Plato would've thoughtwe were gods!

1257
00:19:13,003 --> 00:19:17,272
But we're not, we're justfundamentally flawed

1258
00:19:17,274 --> 00:19:18,774
human beings.

1259
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:24,112
Your glasses,

1260
00:19:24,114 --> 00:19:26,782
for example,make you somewhat,

1261
00:19:26,784 --> 00:19:28,016
um,

1262
00:19:28,018 --> 00:19:29,117
platonic.

1263
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:30,586
But withinthe very near future,

1264
00:19:30,588 --> 00:19:33,288
I'll be able to offeryou the ability

1265
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:35,090
to see into a spectrum

1266
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:38,260
never before seenby the naked eye...

1267
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:40,195
infrared, x-rays,

1268
00:19:40,197 --> 00:19:43,332
ultraviolet.Are you interested?

1269
00:19:43,334 --> 00:19:45,200
Maybe I'll just startwith basic Lasik.

1270
00:19:47,538 --> 00:19:48,971
And so you should.

1271
00:19:48,973 --> 00:19:51,506
That's makingan evolutionary choice.

1272
00:19:51,508 --> 00:19:54,276
Neolution gives usthe opportunity

1273
00:19:54,278 --> 00:19:57,012
at a self-directedevolution

1274
00:19:57,014 --> 00:19:59,948
and I believe that'snot only a choice,

1275
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:04,553
but a human right.

1276
00:20:38,421 --> 00:20:41,356
Ah, Felix,Felix, Felix.

1277
00:20:46,095 --> 00:20:48,497

1687
00:39:26,686 --> 00:39:28,820

1688
00:39:28,822 --> 00:39:30,688
consenting adults.

1689
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:32,790

1691
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:39,597

You rememberGinny Nusbaum?

1703
00:40:52,772 --> 00:40:55,773
From college?

1704
00:40:55,775 --> 00:41:00,411
I don't know howto say this,

1705
00:41:00,413 --> 00:41:02,413
but she and I hadan affair once.

1706
00:41:02,415 --> 00:41:04,282
Okay, twice,

1707
00:41:04,284 --> 00:41:07,352
but you and Iwere broken up.

1708
00:41:07,354 --> 00:41:09,587
We traded lettersfor a few years

1709
00:41:09,589 --> 00:41:12,256
after it ended...

1710
00:41:12,258 --> 00:41:13,891
Dirty talk,mostly...

1711
00:41:13,893 --> 00:41:15,426
Tsk.

1712
00:41:15,428 --> 00:41:17,629
Then, she got Lupus

1713
00:41:17,631 --> 00:41:20,898
and I never heardfrom her again.

1714
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,333
She got Lupus?

1715
00:41:24,236 --> 00:41:29,207
I don't know whathappened to her.

1716
00:41:29,209 --> 00:41:30,274
I'm so sorry.I was just trying

1717
00:41:30,276 --> 00:41:31,776
to hold onto something

1718
00:41:31,778 --> 00:41:35,580

1719
00:41:35,582 --> 00:41:37,415

Clones.

1724
00:42:09,048 --> 00:42:10,048
Clones?

1725
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:12,550
Well, we don't usethe c-word.

1726
00:42:12,552 --> 00:42:16,120
That's Alison's rule.

1727
00:42:16,122 --> 00:42:17,955
But, yeah, we'regenetic identicals.

1728
00:42:17,957 --> 00:42:21,092
Not triplets,

1729
00:42:21,094 --> 00:42:23,127
genetic identicals.

1730
00:42:23,129 --> 00:42:25,863
Yeah, we count nineof us, so far.

1731
00:42:30,836 --> 00:42:32,670

1732
00:42:32,672 --> 00:42:36,040

You monitorhuman clones.

1734
00:42:39,145 --> 00:42:40,812
You should've justtold me that,

00:42:40,814 --> 00:42:43,047
