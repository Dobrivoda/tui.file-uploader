1
00:00:05,224 --> 00:00:07,225
The German was sick. ShouldI be worried about that?

2
00:00:07,227 --> 00:00:09,060
Art... you're aboutthe only person I trust

3
00:00:09,062 --> 00:00:11,062
to figure the whole thing out.

4
00:00:11,064 --> 00:00:12,831
You need a warrantfor Sarah Manning.

5
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:15,166
They can tell usapart by our DNA.

6
00:00:15,168 --> 00:00:16,234
Dig faster.

7
00:00:16,236 --> 00:00:17,902
Cosima's safety is at stake.

8
00:00:17,904 --> 00:00:19,704
Well, she'snot only researching

9
00:00:19,706 --> 00:00:21,139
her own biology,

10
00:00:21,141 --> 00:00:22,507
but she is awareof eight others.

11
00:00:22,509 --> 00:00:24,342
You know, I've never beenwith a woman before.

12
00:00:24,344 --> 00:00:26,244
Yeah, it showed.

13
00:00:26,246 --> 00:00:27,746
Maybe it's not just Aynsley.Maybe they're all monitors.

14
00:00:27,748 --> 00:00:30,315
You want to mess with my life?I'm going to mess with yours.

15
00:00:30,317 --> 00:00:31,983
I'm about to giveHelena to Leekie.

16
00:00:31,985 --> 00:00:34,019
Sorry. She saidshe'd be here.

17
00:00:34,021 --> 00:00:36,554
I grew up pure ina convent in Ukraine.

18
00:00:36,556 --> 00:00:38,223
No!

19
00:00:38,225 --> 00:00:40,592
Where's Helena? I tiedher up in the trunk.

20
00:00:40,594 --> 00:00:41,926
Sarah!

21
00:00:41,928 --> 00:00:43,862
Sarah, this is Amelia.

22
00:00:43,864 --> 00:00:45,497
I'm your birth mother.

23
00:00:45,499 --> 00:00:47,565
I had twins.One to the state

24
00:00:47,567 --> 00:00:48,867
and one to the church.

25
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:50,168
Helena.

26
00:01:17,763 --> 00:01:18,863
Ready?

27
00:01:18,865 --> 00:01:20,265
Yes.

28
00:01:20,267 --> 00:01:21,933
I carried you both.I need to see her.

29
00:01:21,935 --> 00:01:23,935
I don't think that ninemonths of gestation

30
00:01:23,937 --> 00:01:25,637
entitles her to risk us all.

31
00:01:25,639 --> 00:01:28,940
Hey, look, Helena'smy twin sister.

32
00:01:28,942 --> 00:01:30,575
She has a right to know.

33
00:01:30,577 --> 00:01:32,077
Because you shared a womb?

34
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,112
Helena.Is. Dangerous.

35
00:01:34,114 --> 00:01:36,481
She's had her whole worldturned inside out,

36
00:01:36,483 --> 00:01:39,117
just like I have.

37
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,952
How Helena takes this

38
00:01:40,954 --> 00:01:43,024
determines what we do with her.

39
00:01:57,737 --> 00:01:59,404
I need to see you privately,

40
00:01:59,406 --> 00:02:00,672
away from here.

41
00:02:00,674 --> 00:02:02,140
What for?

42
00:02:02,142 --> 00:02:03,375
I have something for you.

43
00:02:03,377 --> 00:02:04,809
From back then,

44
00:02:04,811 --> 00:02:06,911
about my in vitro treatments.

45
00:02:06,913 --> 00:02:09,714
Okay, I've got a place

46
00:02:09,716 --> 00:02:12,550
we can meet.

47
00:02:12,552 --> 00:02:13,651
Helena,

48
00:02:13,653 --> 00:02:16,131
this is Amelia, your birth mum.

49
00:02:21,461 --> 00:02:24,529
Eh, look. Hey!

50
00:02:24,531 --> 00:02:26,398
You listen to whatshe has to say,

51
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,032
or I'll put you rightback in the trunk

52
00:02:28,034 --> 00:02:30,835
and I'll take youstraight to Leekie.

53
00:02:38,477 --> 00:02:40,812
How can you be my birth mother?

54
00:02:40,814 --> 00:02:41,946
Helena,

55
00:02:41,948 --> 00:02:44,115
I am birth mother to you both.

56
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,111
Who's here?

57
00:03:13,113 --> 00:03:17,449
Ah... monkey, you're notsupposed to be up!

58
00:03:17,451 --> 00:03:19,484
What's the matter, love?

59
00:03:19,486 --> 00:03:21,019
I think something bad

60
00:03:21,021 --> 00:03:23,288
is going to happen again.

61
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,523
Yeah, that's what this is,

62
00:03:25,525 --> 00:03:26,758
our connection.

63
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,860
We were implanted by doctors,

64
00:03:28,862 --> 00:03:29,928
all of us.

65
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:33,765
You split inside me,into two baby girls

66
00:03:33,767 --> 00:03:35,500
and I hid you because

67
00:03:35,502 --> 00:03:37,268
I felt you were in danger.

68
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:40,305
Sestra.

69
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:45,009
You're my twin sister.

70
00:03:45,011 --> 00:03:48,980
I don't want to beyour sister, meathead.

71
00:03:48,982 --> 00:03:50,849
Look, I just want you to know

72
00:03:50,851 --> 00:03:52,283
you're not the original.

73
00:03:52,285 --> 00:03:54,719
Got it? You were bornof science,

74
00:03:54,721 --> 00:03:57,856
not of some immaculate womb,

75
00:03:57,858 --> 00:03:59,691
or whatever bullshitTomas fed you.

76
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,504
This is the police!

77
00:04:12,506 --> 00:04:14,639
- Shit. Sarah!- We have a warrant!

78
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:20,278
This isyour last warning!

79
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,646
Sit down.You're just visiting.

80
00:04:26,986 --> 00:04:28,453
Sarah Manning!

81
00:04:28,455 --> 00:04:30,121
- Come out with your hands up!- Come out now!

82
00:04:36,829 --> 00:04:38,863
Put your hands on your head!

83
00:04:38,865 --> 00:04:40,265
- Turn around!- Hands up, now!

84
00:04:43,969 --> 00:04:46,738
Sarah Manning,you're under arrest.

85
00:04:56,516 --> 00:04:59,083
Let's go.

86
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,686
Orphan Black 01x10Endless Forms Most Beautiful
Original Air Date June 1, 2013

87
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:49,934
Sarah.

88
00:05:51,437 --> 00:05:53,204
I still see Beth.

89
00:05:53,206 --> 00:05:55,974
I didn't kill her, Art.

90
00:05:55,976 --> 00:05:57,675
No.

91
00:05:57,677 --> 00:06:00,445
You watched her commit suicide

92
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,313
and then you wentstraight for her wallet.

93
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,386
Beckwith finished

94
00:06:08,388 --> 00:06:10,555
Jane Doe's facialreconstruction.

95
00:06:10,557 --> 00:06:13,691
Who's this one?

96
00:06:13,693 --> 00:06:16,361
You've been obstructingthis investigation

97
00:06:16,363 --> 00:06:18,463
from the minute youtook over Beth's life.

98
00:06:18,465 --> 00:06:20,098
You're the primesuspect, Sarah.

99
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,532
I didn't kill her, Art!

100
00:06:21,534 --> 00:06:25,136
You know who did?

101
00:06:25,138 --> 00:06:27,305
We've got yourfoster brother Felix

102
00:06:27,307 --> 00:06:29,707
in custody for abettingand your daughter?

103
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:31,175
She's going to beone lonely little girl,

104
00:06:31,177 --> 00:06:32,610
unless you start talking!

105
00:06:32,612 --> 00:06:34,712
You wouldn't believe it.

106
00:06:34,714 --> 00:06:37,215
Yeah?

107
00:06:37,217 --> 00:06:40,251
Try me.

108
00:06:40,253 --> 00:06:43,121
Good, slide it out again, go.

109
00:06:43,123 --> 00:06:45,590
Go, come on,feel it work. Go.

110
00:06:45,592 --> 00:06:46,891
Mnh! Push it up.

111
00:06:46,893 --> 00:06:49,127
You got it.Clap it high.

112
00:06:49,129 --> 00:06:50,361
You know what?

113
00:06:50,363 --> 00:06:52,430
Slide it out for 2.Here's 2.

114
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:56,567
Slide it to the rightagain. Go...

115
00:06:56,569 --> 00:06:59,604
Mnh!

116
00:07:09,915 --> 00:07:11,049
Yeah?

117
00:07:11,051 --> 00:07:13,651
Alison!

118
00:07:13,653 --> 00:07:15,353
Dr. Aldous Leekie.

119
00:07:15,355 --> 00:07:16,854
It's a lovely home.

120
00:07:16,856 --> 00:07:18,322
I'm warning you...

121
00:07:18,324 --> 00:07:19,991
I'm armed.

122
00:07:19,993 --> 00:07:22,026
What do you want?

123
00:07:22,028 --> 00:07:23,561
To make amends.

124
00:07:26,799 --> 00:07:29,701
So, you want meto sign a contract.

125
00:07:29,703 --> 00:07:31,469
No, more like a treaty...

126
00:07:31,471 --> 00:07:34,272
Rules both sides will abide by.

127
00:07:34,274 --> 00:07:35,973
Even though everythingyou've done is illegal.

128
00:07:35,975 --> 00:07:38,142
You must think I'm so stupid.

129
00:07:38,144 --> 00:07:39,977
Stupid, suburban Alison.

130
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:41,446
Quite the opposite.

131
00:07:41,448 --> 00:07:44,148
You're a pragmaticand decisive individual

132
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:46,384
and, now thatyou're self-aware,

133
00:07:46,386 --> 00:07:48,853
we can start to answersome of your questions.

134
00:07:48,855 --> 00:07:50,922
I don't wantanswers anymore.

135
00:07:50,924 --> 00:07:52,356
I want my life back.

136
00:07:52,358 --> 00:07:55,727
I want my family back,I want my privacy back,

137
00:07:55,729 --> 00:07:58,196
I want you out of my life!

138
00:07:58,198 --> 00:07:59,831
And I want thingsto be normal again.

139
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,434
I'm so glad you said so.

140
00:08:05,471 --> 00:08:09,307
This enshrines yourfamily's freedom,

141
00:08:09,309 --> 00:08:10,842
guarantees protection

142
00:08:10,844 --> 00:08:13,010
from the likes of Helena,

143
00:08:13,012 --> 00:08:15,546
and ensures you'll beunmonitored.

144
00:08:15,548 --> 00:08:17,348
Unmonitored?

145
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,317
Yes.

146
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:21,419
But in return, you agree

147
00:08:21,421 --> 00:08:23,121
to twice-yearlymedical testing,

148
00:08:23,123 --> 00:08:25,289
private and noninvasive.

149
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:28,025
I don't want to scare you, but,

150
00:08:28,027 --> 00:08:30,595
there are health concerns...

151
00:08:30,597 --> 00:08:33,264
Katja's respiratory disorder,

152
00:08:33,266 --> 00:08:35,600
Helena's mental illness.

153
00:08:35,602 --> 00:08:37,101
Regular testing is

154
00:08:37,103 --> 00:08:39,337
in everyone's best interest.

155
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:41,272
So,

156
00:08:41,274 --> 00:08:43,808
read it over,

157
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:45,877
discuss it withSarah and Cosima.

158
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:47,812
And, as a gestureof good faith,

159
00:08:47,814 --> 00:08:50,615
your monitor has been lifted.

160
00:08:50,617 --> 00:08:52,483
She has?

161
00:08:52,485 --> 00:08:53,785
Mm-hmm.

162
00:08:53,787 --> 00:08:57,789
Don't get up.

163
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,866
You purposely misidentified

164
00:09:08,868 --> 00:09:10,668
the body of a police officer.

165
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,871
It was a terrible caseof mistaken identity.

166
00:09:13,873 --> 00:09:16,307
You know it's fraud byfalse representation.

167
00:09:16,309 --> 00:09:17,975
That's 2 to 5,with your priors.

168
00:09:17,977 --> 00:09:19,744
I thought it was my sister.

169
00:09:19,746 --> 00:09:21,379
You know,

170
00:09:21,381 --> 00:09:22,880
Angela Deangelis,

171
00:09:22,882 --> 00:09:24,315
I'm actually quite a fan.

172
00:09:24,317 --> 00:09:26,484
Hmm.

173
00:09:26,486 --> 00:09:28,586
But you really needto get laid.

174
00:09:30,356 --> 00:09:32,290
Yeah, tell me about it.

175
00:09:32,292 --> 00:09:34,692
But all I seem to meetare gay men.

176
00:09:34,694 --> 00:09:36,093
So,

177
00:09:36,095 --> 00:09:38,729
public defender, then, is it?

178
00:09:38,731 --> 00:09:40,765
We'll get youa real shitty one.

179
00:09:48,707 --> 00:09:49,774
Thank you.

180
00:10:11,697 --> 00:10:12,797
Cosima!

181
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:14,799
Please,

182
00:10:14,801 --> 00:10:16,567
don't be alarmed.

183
00:10:16,569 --> 00:10:18,970
I'm beyond alarmed.I'm pissed.

184
00:10:18,972 --> 00:10:21,072
Let me give you a liftto your hotel.

185
00:10:21,074 --> 00:10:24,308
I have an offer youmay find interesting.

186
00:10:28,881 --> 00:10:30,748
It's your phone.

187
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,418
Well, it's Beth'sphone, actually.

188
00:10:36,255 --> 00:10:38,623
So help me wrap my head

189
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,224
around this.

190
00:10:40,226 --> 00:10:42,126
Art, if you're hearing this,

191
00:10:42,128 --> 00:10:43,628
you found the body.

192
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:46,998
It's not Beth.It's me.

193
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,567
My name is Sarah Manning and...

194
00:10:49,569 --> 00:10:51,269
You're about the onlyperson I trust

195
00:10:51,271 --> 00:10:52,770
to figure the whole thing out.

196
00:10:59,745 --> 00:11:02,146
Sarah, my partnerkilled herself.

197
00:11:02,148 --> 00:11:04,181
I didn't see it coming.

198
00:11:04,183 --> 00:11:06,617
Help me.

199
00:11:06,619 --> 00:11:08,920
Help Beth.

200
00:11:08,922 --> 00:11:11,822
I know you care.

201
00:11:11,824 --> 00:11:13,324
There's a reason

202
00:11:13,326 --> 00:11:17,628
we look exactly the same, Art.

203
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:20,331
Okay.

204
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:24,769
Why the prints match,

205
00:11:24,771 --> 00:11:29,874
and the DNA's all screwed up.

206
00:11:29,876 --> 00:11:33,444
But you have to promise

207
00:11:33,446 --> 00:11:35,012
to protect me and my daughter.

208
00:11:35,014 --> 00:11:36,113
I will.

209
00:11:36,115 --> 00:11:38,616
If that's what you need,

210
00:11:38,618 --> 00:11:40,051
I promise.

211
00:11:46,693 --> 00:11:48,359
Detective, thisinterview is over.

212
00:11:48,361 --> 00:11:49,593
What is this?

213
00:11:49,595 --> 00:11:50,661
Sorry, Art.

214
00:11:50,663 --> 00:11:52,863
Miss Manning, I'm your lawyer,

215
00:11:52,865 --> 00:11:54,765
Daniel Rosen.

216
00:11:54,767 --> 00:11:57,268
Unshackle her, please.

217
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,737
Miss Manning will beleaving with me.

218
00:12:03,642 --> 00:12:05,943
Thank you, gentlemen.Miss Manning.

219
00:12:13,552 --> 00:12:16,587
This is an employment contract

220
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:17,888
for the Dyad Institute.

221
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:20,624
Very generous compensation.

222
00:12:20,626 --> 00:12:22,360
We want to workwith you, Cosima.

223
00:12:22,362 --> 00:12:24,829
You'vegot to be kidding me.

224
00:12:24,831 --> 00:12:28,399
This is your completesequenced genome.

225
00:12:28,401 --> 00:12:32,603
3.2 billionbase pairs.

226
00:12:32,605 --> 00:12:33,804
My offer

227
00:12:33,806 --> 00:12:36,340
is the freedomto study yourself

228
00:12:36,342 --> 00:12:38,309
and your sisters.

229
00:12:38,311 --> 00:12:41,345
Unfettered research.

230
00:12:43,682 --> 00:12:46,417
We share the same concerns,

231
00:12:46,419 --> 00:12:48,486
the same questions aboutorganism stability,

232
00:12:48,488 --> 00:12:50,521
but nobody... nobody...

233
00:12:50,523 --> 00:12:53,090
Is more invested in yourown biology than you!

234
00:12:53,092 --> 00:12:55,693
It's yours.

235
00:12:55,695 --> 00:12:58,095
Just think about it.

236
00:13:03,835 --> 00:13:05,302
Where are you taking me?

237
00:13:05,304 --> 00:13:06,871
We had your brotherreleased as well.

238
00:13:06,873 --> 00:13:09,340
Who's "we"? You workfor Dr. Leekie?

239
00:13:09,342 --> 00:13:10,875
Indirectly.

240
00:13:18,116 --> 00:13:20,384
Great, should've known.

241
00:13:20,386 --> 00:13:22,186
Can we have a minute?

242
00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:29,160
You left me hangingwith Leekie

243
00:13:29,162 --> 00:13:30,628
when you didn'tshow up with Helena.

244
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,962
Do you work for Leekie now?

245
00:13:31,964 --> 00:13:34,031
They still haveAfghanistan on me,

246
00:13:34,033 --> 00:13:35,099
understand?

247
00:13:35,101 --> 00:13:37,802
What is that?

248
00:13:37,804 --> 00:13:40,905
You changed the gamefor everyone, Sarah.

249
00:13:40,907 --> 00:13:42,540
Now, I can onlyhelp you from here.

250
00:13:42,542 --> 00:13:46,310
Listen to whatthey have to say.

251
00:13:46,312 --> 00:13:50,147
Do I have a choice?

252
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:09,967
Right.

253
00:14:09,969 --> 00:14:12,236
Sarah Manning.

254
00:14:12,238 --> 00:14:13,304
So,

255
00:14:13,306 --> 00:14:15,673
my name is Rachel Duncan

256
00:14:15,675 --> 00:14:17,007
and we are going tocome to terms.

257
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,249
The agreement defines

258
00:14:25,251 --> 00:14:28,352
mutual disclosureand formalizes contact

259
00:14:28,354 --> 00:14:30,387
with what I call "Top Side".

260
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:32,556
"Top Side"?

261
00:14:32,558 --> 00:14:33,891
So is this the partwhere 20 more

262
00:14:33,893 --> 00:14:36,594
of you robot bitcheswalk in for effect?

263
00:14:36,596 --> 00:14:40,264
You're not an orphananymore, Sarah.

264
00:14:40,266 --> 00:14:41,999
We found you

265
00:14:42,001 --> 00:14:44,535
and my role isto transition you

266
00:14:44,537 --> 00:14:46,470
to self-awareness.

267
00:14:46,472 --> 00:14:48,205
A clone fixer.

268
00:14:48,207 --> 00:14:49,940
Brilliant.

269
00:14:49,942 --> 00:14:51,609
You know,

270
00:14:51,611 --> 00:14:54,078
maybe it's time I justembraced my clonage,

271
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,347
went on "Oprah".

272
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,684
We could be famous,you and me.

273
00:15:00,686 --> 00:15:02,620
We're not the enemy.

274
00:15:02,622 --> 00:15:05,122
Helena and her ilk are

275
00:15:05,124 --> 00:15:07,191
and we are going tohelp with that.

276
00:15:07,193 --> 00:15:08,692
You want to help?

277
00:15:08,694 --> 00:15:10,294
Why don't you tell me why?

278
00:15:10,296 --> 00:15:12,029
What am I doing, sathere, looking at you?

279
00:15:12,031 --> 00:15:13,631
What are we for?

280
00:15:13,633 --> 00:15:15,065
Disclosure

281
00:15:15,067 --> 00:15:17,134
is defined herein.

282
00:15:17,136 --> 00:15:20,037
We want your trust.

283
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:21,672
You want precious answers

284
00:15:21,674 --> 00:15:23,774
that cut to the coreof who you are.

285
00:15:23,776 --> 00:15:25,910
But, above all,

286
00:15:25,912 --> 00:15:27,878
I know you want to makethe right choice

287
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,413
for Kira.

288
00:15:29,415 --> 00:15:33,217
You're very lucky.

289
00:15:33,219 --> 00:15:34,818
Motherhood is wonderful.

290
00:15:40,325 --> 00:15:41,892
The forces behind Helena

291
00:15:41,894 --> 00:15:44,962
will never stop, Sarah.

292
00:15:44,964 --> 00:15:46,897
The most importantthing in this for you

293
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:48,732
is protection

294
00:15:48,734 --> 00:15:50,768
for you and your daughter.

295
00:15:53,306 --> 00:15:54,772
Yeah, no, thanks.

296
00:15:54,774 --> 00:15:56,440
I'll get by on my own.

297
00:15:56,442 --> 00:15:57,908
Scrambling to stay alive?

298
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:00,177
You'll remain free

299
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:02,079
to live as you wish with Kira,

300
00:16:02,081 --> 00:16:03,614
provided for;

301
00:16:03,616 --> 00:16:05,616
unmonitored, but available.

302
00:16:05,618 --> 00:16:07,985
Call it "sovereigntyassociation."

303
00:16:07,987 --> 00:16:09,987
Yeah, like I said,

304
00:16:09,989 --> 00:16:13,791
I'm not interested.

305
00:16:13,793 --> 00:16:16,026
Take 24 hours

306
00:16:16,028 --> 00:16:18,128
to think about it.

307
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:20,297
Midnight tomorrow.

308
00:16:23,668 --> 00:16:27,838
They're offering ussecurity, a truce.

309
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,174
Rachel didn't feellike a truce.

310
00:16:30,176 --> 00:16:31,942
She felt likea gun to the head.

311
00:16:31,944 --> 00:16:33,911
Okay, little reminder?

312
00:16:33,913 --> 00:16:35,679
While you and Iwere being arrested,

313
00:16:35,681 --> 00:16:36,780
Helena escaped.

314
00:16:36,782 --> 00:16:38,716
Yeah, thank you, Fe.

315
00:16:38,718 --> 00:16:40,351
Would you also liketo remind me

316
00:16:40,353 --> 00:16:41,852
my birth mum popped round

317
00:16:41,854 --> 00:16:44,188
and Helena's my twin sister?

318
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:48,492
Ah, Jesus Murphy.

319
00:16:48,494 --> 00:16:50,027
Hey.

320
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:53,397
Hi.

321
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:54,431
Hi.

322
00:16:56,768 --> 00:16:59,903
Uh, Sarah, I

323
00:16:59,905 --> 00:17:01,205
so should've listened to you

324
00:17:01,207 --> 00:17:05,442
about Delphine.I...

325
00:17:05,444 --> 00:17:07,011
You're all right.

326
00:17:16,021 --> 00:17:18,055
A career at the Dyad Institute.

327
00:17:18,057 --> 00:17:20,557
Yeah, studying us.

328
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,293
What are yougoing to do, Cosima?

329
00:17:22,295 --> 00:17:24,194
Well,

330
00:17:24,196 --> 00:17:26,063
we have to knowour own biology.

331
00:17:26,065 --> 00:17:28,599
That's what thisis all about, right?

332
00:17:28,601 --> 00:17:31,302
Maybe I can help us best

333
00:17:31,304 --> 00:17:33,871
from the inside.

334
00:17:33,873 --> 00:17:36,106
I want to know whatyou're going to do.

335
00:17:36,108 --> 00:17:38,042
Well, I can't trust thisRachel bitch, can I?

336
00:17:38,044 --> 00:17:40,277
Not if Kira's the firstchild of a clone,

337
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:42,446
scientifically unclassified.

338
00:17:42,448 --> 00:17:45,215
She could be whatRachel's actually after.

339
00:17:45,217 --> 00:17:47,685
Who is Rachel?Can someone tell me?

340
00:17:47,687 --> 00:17:49,086
So she doesn't justshow up at my door

341
00:17:49,088 --> 00:17:50,521
and I have no idea who she is.

342
00:17:50,523 --> 00:17:51,955
Amelia said

343
00:17:51,957 --> 00:17:53,824
she heard her doctors,back in the day,

344
00:17:53,826 --> 00:17:56,593
discussing a childraised by neolution.

345
00:17:56,595 --> 00:17:58,128
She's a proclone?

346
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:01,765
God, you threeare weird enough.

347
00:18:01,767 --> 00:18:04,001
Well, if there won't beany more spies

348
00:18:04,003 --> 00:18:06,403
in my life,if my kids are safe,

349
00:18:06,405 --> 00:18:07,805
I'm sorry,

350
00:18:07,807 --> 00:18:09,539
but I have to tell youI'm inclined

351
00:18:09,659 --> 00:18:11,451
to take the offer.

352
00:18:13,479 --> 00:18:16,513
Yeah, that's okay.

353
00:18:16,515 --> 00:18:17,915
That's totally your choice.

354
00:18:17,917 --> 00:18:20,217
Yeah, no judgment.

355
00:18:23,055 --> 00:18:25,556
Oh, shit.

356
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:27,758
Delphine just got off a plane.

357
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,260
Here? Stupid,needy bitch.

358
00:18:30,262 --> 00:18:32,763
Right.

359
00:18:32,765 --> 00:18:34,765
She wants to help, right?

360
00:18:34,767 --> 00:18:37,234
Just like Art, Paul,and Rachel.

361
00:18:37,236 --> 00:18:38,936
Everybody wants to help.

362
00:18:38,938 --> 00:18:40,838
I'm going to Mrs S's.

363
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,840
I want to be therewhen Kira wakes up.

364
00:18:42,842 --> 00:18:45,109
I'll catch up.

365
00:18:45,111 --> 00:18:46,610
Yeah, I mean, we makeour own decisions,

366
00:18:46,612 --> 00:18:49,747
but I wouldn't trust anybody.

367
00:18:49,749 --> 00:18:51,815
Katja Obinger.

368
00:18:51,817 --> 00:18:53,250
German?

369
00:18:53,252 --> 00:18:54,251
Yeah.

370
00:18:54,253 --> 00:18:55,919
We finally ID'ed our Jane Doe

371
00:18:55,921 --> 00:18:58,288
and she falls underFederal jurisdiction.

372
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:00,357
This whole thing reeks.

373
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,095
Hey, you still wantto get to the bottom

374
00:19:05,097 --> 00:19:06,463
of Sarah Manning?

375
00:19:10,468 --> 00:19:12,269
I found a known associate.

376
00:19:14,539 --> 00:19:16,974
I guess my turning point was

377
00:19:16,976 --> 00:19:18,442
when the love of my life...

378
00:19:18,444 --> 00:19:20,644
Let's just call her "Sarah"...

379
00:19:20,646 --> 00:19:24,581
Sarah broke up with meby faking her own death,

380
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:28,452
initiating events which began

381
00:19:28,454 --> 00:19:29,853
with the loss of my finger,

382
00:19:29,855 --> 00:19:34,425
led to variousother humiliations,

383
00:19:34,427 --> 00:19:36,026
and, ultimately,

384
00:19:36,028 --> 00:19:39,263
to the business endof a nail gun.

385
00:19:39,265 --> 00:19:41,598
That's when I justsaid to myself

386
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:47,337
"I need help.I need help."

387
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:49,039
So

388
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,675
Like I said before,my name's Victor.

389
00:19:51,677 --> 00:19:57,815
I'm an addict,maybe, you know, so...

390
00:20:00,051 --> 00:20:01,084
Peace out.

391
00:20:39,491 --> 00:20:41,725
You're moving.

392
00:20:41,727 --> 00:20:44,561
Yes. Chad got his ownplace with the dog

393
00:20:44,563 --> 00:20:45,996
and I got a very handsome offer

394
00:20:45,998 --> 00:20:47,431
on the house.

395
00:20:47,433 --> 00:20:49,533
It's the perfect opportunity

396
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,101
to get the kids out ofthis toxic environment.

397
00:20:51,103 --> 00:20:54,037
Mm, that's priceless.

398
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:56,607
Goodbye, Alison.I'm packing.

399
00:21:01,446 --> 00:21:03,680
Oh, Alison, get out!

400
00:21:03,682 --> 00:21:05,015
Admit it!

401
00:21:05,017 --> 00:21:07,351
Admit what?!

402
00:21:07,353 --> 00:21:08,785
That I organizedyour intervention?

403
00:21:08,787 --> 00:21:11,922
My bad.Sorry I care.

404
00:21:11,924 --> 00:21:13,757
Dr. Leekie cameto see me.

405
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:14,858
Who?

406
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,194
Cray-cray! If it'sprofessional help,

407
00:21:17,196 --> 00:21:18,929
I'm all for it.

408
00:21:18,931 --> 00:21:23,267
I want the truth, Aynsley!

409
00:21:23,269 --> 00:21:25,235
- The truth?!- Mm-hmm.

410
00:21:25,237 --> 00:21:27,938
Is that you screwed my husband

411
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:30,207
and I'm moving because of you!

412
00:21:30,209 --> 00:21:33,210
Look at this!Yours!

413
00:21:33,212 --> 00:21:35,779
Gifts from my best friend!

414
00:21:35,781 --> 00:21:38,882
A felt Christmas angel.

415
00:21:38,884 --> 00:21:40,250
I made that!

416
00:21:40,252 --> 00:21:41,485
- Yeah?- Yes!

417
00:21:41,487 --> 00:21:42,986
Well, to hell with you

418
00:21:42,988 --> 00:21:44,354
and your Christmas angel.

419
00:21:47,058 --> 00:21:49,126
You know, you,

420
00:21:49,128 --> 00:21:52,095
you turned this wholething around on me

421
00:21:52,097 --> 00:21:53,564
because you're jealous.

422
00:21:53,566 --> 00:21:55,966
You're barrenand you can't have

423
00:21:55,968 --> 00:21:57,467
your own children!

424
00:21:57,469 --> 00:21:59,136
Oh!

425
00:21:59,138 --> 00:22:00,804
Oh.

426
00:22:00,806 --> 00:22:02,306
Oh, my God!

427
00:22:02,308 --> 00:22:03,807
Alison, help!

428
00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:05,342
Uggh!

429
00:22:05,344 --> 00:22:07,778
Ohh!

430
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,680
Alison, help me!

431
00:22:09,682 --> 00:22:13,417
Ow!

432
00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:16,320
Ahh!Alison!

433
00:22:20,425 --> 00:22:21,858
Alison!

434
00:22:34,572 --> 00:22:35,806
Aynsley.

435
00:22:37,642 --> 00:22:39,943
Aynsley?

436
00:22:44,182 --> 00:22:46,750
Aynsley.

437
00:23:27,514 --> 00:23:28,747
Nice speech.

438
00:23:28,749 --> 00:23:30,149
Yeah, I'm moved, personally.

439
00:23:30,151 --> 00:23:32,017
Isn't this place off-limits to you guys?

440
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:33,786
You know, sacredground or something?

441
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:35,654
Not if you gotan outstanding warrant

442
00:23:35,656 --> 00:23:37,656
for selling stolen meat?

443
00:23:37,658 --> 00:23:39,091
No, smoked pork.

444
00:23:39,093 --> 00:23:42,361
I didn't know it was stolen.

445
00:23:42,363 --> 00:23:43,896
You know, that's lame,

446
00:23:43,898 --> 00:23:45,597
but I'll take the collar.

447
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:46,999
Eh, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, man!

448
00:23:47,001 --> 00:23:49,701
I'm trying to turnmy life around.

449
00:23:49,703 --> 00:23:51,236
All right, okay, so thengive us something useful

450
00:23:51,238 --> 00:23:52,871
on your femme fataleSarah Manning.

451
00:23:52,873 --> 00:23:56,475
Of course, Sarah.

452
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:57,910
Step 9 of the program,

453
00:23:57,912 --> 00:23:59,378
I got to suck it upand apologize

454
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,380
for shit that I did to her.You believe that?

455
00:24:01,382 --> 00:24:04,683
But, since she's not going toapologize back...

456
00:24:04,685 --> 00:24:06,852
Last time I saw Sarah,she was playing housewife

457
00:24:06,854 --> 00:24:08,187
in the suburbs.

458
00:24:08,189 --> 00:24:11,757
Husband, kids, minivan,the whole shebang.

459
00:24:48,561 --> 00:24:49,895
That...

460
00:24:49,897 --> 00:24:52,097
That isn't SarahManning, is it?

461
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:53,098
No.

462
00:24:56,132 --> 00:24:58,270
That is anotherperson, entirely.

463
00:24:58,272 --> 00:25:00,539
You got to befriggin' kidding me.

464
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:12,017
When police come,mummy goes away.

465
00:25:12,019 --> 00:25:14,586
No, darling, not this time.

466
00:25:14,588 --> 00:25:15,787
She's back.

467
00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:19,057
To keep us safe from Helena.

468
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:21,126
Don't worry about Helena,

469
00:25:21,128 --> 00:25:23,295
Kira, okay?

470
00:25:23,297 --> 00:25:24,930
I don't.

471
00:25:24,932 --> 00:25:27,065
She's not a real monster.

472
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,568
Okay,

473
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:32,037
we're going tohave to hide this bag.

474
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:34,506
We might have to go on a trip,

475
00:25:34,508 --> 00:25:36,141
but you can't tell anybody.

476
00:25:36,143 --> 00:25:38,577
Eh.

477
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:40,212
Not even Mrs S.

478
00:25:40,214 --> 00:25:41,580
It's a secret.

479
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:43,081
Yeah? Promise?

480
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,083
Okay.

481
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,585
Do you have a spare toothbrush?

482
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:47,886
Go get it.

483
00:25:47,888 --> 00:25:50,088
- Go.- Okay.

484
00:25:58,998 --> 00:26:00,532
Where are you off to?

485
00:26:00,534 --> 00:26:03,602
Meeting Amelia.

486
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:05,270
You all right?

487
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,906
Just edgy, withHelena in the wind.

488
00:26:07,908 --> 00:26:09,100
Yeah.

489
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,443
Sarah, mind Amelia.

490
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:13,612
Why?

491
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:15,781
It's true, right, thatshe's my birth mum?

492
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:18,050
Yeah, it all seemsto track, just...

493
00:26:18,052 --> 00:26:19,551
She didn't raise you.

494
00:26:19,553 --> 00:26:21,053
Yeah, I know.

495
00:26:21,055 --> 00:26:22,721
You did.

496
00:26:22,723 --> 00:26:27,259
It was all a long time ago.

497
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,255
You all right?

498
00:26:57,257 --> 00:27:00,125
Yeah.Yeah, sorry.

499
00:27:12,739 --> 00:27:14,206
Oh.

500
00:27:14,208 --> 00:27:16,808
Well, now, I get it.

501
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:20,412
Um, is Cosima...?is sh...

502
00:27:20,414 --> 00:27:22,781
It's Delphine!

503
00:27:22,783 --> 00:27:24,349
She's got baggage!

504
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:36,662
You know, if Sarah were here,

505
00:27:36,664 --> 00:27:38,597
she'd kick your willowy arse.

506
00:27:44,737 --> 00:27:46,171
I promise you...

507
00:27:46,173 --> 00:27:48,540
I did not tell Leekieabout Sarah's child.

508
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:50,509
What difference does it make?

509
00:27:50,511 --> 00:27:52,678
Why are you here?

510
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,147
Because I...

511
00:27:55,149 --> 00:27:57,049
Because Leekie is a liar

512
00:27:57,051 --> 00:27:58,884
and I think you canprove it scientifically

513
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:01,153
with that, yoursynthetic sequence.

514
00:28:01,155 --> 00:28:03,221
He gave me my whole genome.

515
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:06,525
But you can't find

516
00:28:06,527 --> 00:28:09,227
that sequence anymore, can you?

517
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,263
He would've scrubbed it.

518
00:28:18,771 --> 00:28:19,871
Don't.

519
00:28:19,873 --> 00:28:25,577
I'm on your side now.

520
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:26,945
Please believe me.

521
00:28:29,482 --> 00:28:31,650
You need to trust someone.

522
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:40,158
I think the sequence is

523
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,828
a message.

524
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,062
Like

525
00:28:44,064 --> 00:28:46,898
Dr. Craig Venter

526
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:50,302
watermarked his synthetic DNA.

527
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:53,371
It's a key to our origins.

528
00:28:53,373 --> 00:28:55,173
May I?

529
00:28:57,643 --> 00:28:58,677
Mm-hmm.

530
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:00,612
Okay.

531
00:29:04,418 --> 00:29:06,618
Thank you formeeting me, Sarah.

532
00:29:18,064 --> 00:29:19,097
Drink?

533
00:29:19,099 --> 00:29:20,899
Just water.

534
00:29:20,901 --> 00:29:23,468
That poor child, Helena.

535
00:29:25,571 --> 00:29:27,806
How can two fates beso different?

536
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:30,342
You two are likenight and day.

537
00:29:35,581 --> 00:29:37,382
Thank you.

538
00:29:37,384 --> 00:29:40,952
I'm sorry to bring yousuch burdens,

539
00:29:40,954 --> 00:29:42,821
but I must warn you, Sarah.

540
00:29:42,823 --> 00:29:45,157
Your foster mother, Mrs S,

541
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:47,359
she's not who she says she is.

542
00:29:47,361 --> 00:29:48,860
I have somethingyou should see.

543
00:29:50,429 --> 00:29:52,831
How did scientists

544
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:54,599
put babies inside you?

545
00:29:54,601 --> 00:29:55,600
What?

546
00:30:09,415 --> 00:30:11,116
You gave me to them.

547
00:30:11,118 --> 00:30:13,819
You let them make me this way.

548
00:30:19,026 --> 00:30:21,993
No!

549
00:30:39,693 --> 00:30:40,760
Oh!

550
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,347
Helena,what have you done?

551
00:31:01,349 --> 00:31:05,185
We missed you, sister.Come join us.

552
00:31:11,226 --> 00:31:12,926
Alison?

553
00:31:12,928 --> 00:31:15,228
Donnie...

554
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:17,130
Ally.

555
00:31:17,132 --> 00:31:18,331
Ally, you're shaking.

556
00:31:21,436 --> 00:31:22,869
I'm a horrible person.

557
00:31:22,871 --> 00:31:25,905
No. No, honey.I am.

558
00:31:25,907 --> 00:31:27,974
I let those people in our home.

559
00:31:27,976 --> 00:31:29,409
They had no right

560
00:31:29,411 --> 00:31:31,077
to intervention you like that.

561
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:33,713
They don't know the real you.

562
00:31:33,715 --> 00:31:35,882
Oh, Judas priest.What have I done?!

563
00:31:35,884 --> 00:31:37,550
No, no, no no no.

564
00:31:37,552 --> 00:31:39,619
It doesn't matter.

565
00:31:39,621 --> 00:31:41,921
We can put it all behind us,

566
00:31:41,923 --> 00:31:44,057
every little bit of it. Really?

567
00:31:44,059 --> 00:31:45,892
Yeah.

568
00:31:45,894 --> 00:31:47,627
Really?!

569
00:31:57,104 --> 00:31:59,973
Okay, here's thesynthetic sequence.

570
00:31:59,975 --> 00:32:01,741
And this is thedifferentiated portion.

571
00:32:01,743 --> 00:32:04,444
Yes, this isan encrypted I.D. tag.

572
00:32:04,446 --> 00:32:06,179
It's how they tell you apart.

573
00:32:06,181 --> 00:32:08,848
Okay. But howto decode it?

574
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:10,783
I have four nucleotidesto work with...

575
00:32:10,785 --> 00:32:13,353
G, C, T, and A...

576
00:32:13,355 --> 00:32:16,189
And no idea how they'reencrypted. I mean,

577
00:32:16,191 --> 00:32:17,690
there's thousandsof permutations

578
00:32:17,692 --> 00:32:19,192
and we're running out of time.

579
00:32:19,194 --> 00:32:20,660
Yes, but I knowyour tag number.

580
00:32:20,662 --> 00:32:22,195
You do?

581
00:32:22,197 --> 00:32:23,830
Yes, I saw it many times.

582
00:32:23,832 --> 00:32:25,932
It's numeric, so,

583
00:32:25,934 --> 00:32:27,834
if we know how that translates,

584
00:32:27,836 --> 00:32:29,169
then we can figureout the rest.

585
00:32:29,171 --> 00:32:30,470
Okay.What is it?

586
00:32:30,472 --> 00:32:33,173
It's 324b21.

587
00:32:33,175 --> 00:32:35,708
324b21.

588
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:38,344
Right.

589
00:32:38,346 --> 00:32:40,013
I'm 324b21.

590
00:32:42,016 --> 00:32:43,883
I'm sorry.

591
00:32:43,885 --> 00:32:45,385
Well, let's run these letters

592
00:32:45,387 --> 00:32:46,819
through a decryption program.

593
00:32:46,821 --> 00:32:49,022
Yeah.

594
00:32:55,129 --> 00:32:56,529
Helena!

595
00:33:21,188 --> 00:33:22,956
Helena!

596
00:33:39,707 --> 00:33:42,875
Ugh! Noneof these results

597
00:33:42,877 --> 00:33:44,611
match the I.D. tag.

598
00:33:44,613 --> 00:33:46,746
Okay.Okay, think.

599
00:33:46,748 --> 00:33:49,349
We're molecular-encoding,

600
00:33:49,351 --> 00:33:51,251
from 30 years ago.

601
00:33:51,253 --> 00:33:53,553
Yes, but we're lookingat it from now.

602
00:33:53,555 --> 00:33:55,955
Of course.

603
00:33:55,957 --> 00:33:58,057
They weren'tcoding nucleotides.

604
00:33:58,059 --> 00:33:59,926
It was whole base pairs?

605
00:33:59,928 --> 00:34:03,396
Not four letters,but two, AT and GC.

606
00:34:03,398 --> 00:34:06,532
Ones and zeros.

607
00:34:06,534 --> 00:34:08,868
Binary.

608
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,737
They were coding in ASCII!

609
00:34:22,383 --> 00:34:24,083
Shit!

610
00:34:24,085 --> 00:34:25,318
Amelia!

611
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,422
Amelia.

612
00:34:29,424 --> 00:34:31,224
Amelia...

613
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:33,926
Keep pressure.

614
00:34:33,928 --> 00:34:35,495
I'm going to get you help.

615
00:34:38,966 --> 00:34:40,133
What's this?

616
00:34:40,135 --> 00:34:43,469
Your foster mother.

617
00:34:43,471 --> 00:34:45,805
She what?She what?

618
00:34:45,807 --> 00:34:48,775
Foster mother.

619
00:34:50,611 --> 00:34:52,011
Shh shh shh.

620
00:34:57,951 --> 00:34:59,052
She What?

621
00:35:04,024 --> 00:35:06,993
Moja Sestra.

622
00:35:06,995 --> 00:35:08,294
My twin.

623
00:35:13,634 --> 00:35:15,902
Amelia.

624
00:35:23,644 --> 00:35:26,245
I'm sorry, motherisn't very well.

625
00:35:26,247 --> 00:35:28,614
She's dead,

626
00:35:28,616 --> 00:35:30,316
you psycho.

627
00:35:30,318 --> 00:35:31,818
You killed someone I'vebeen dreaming about

628
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,686
my whole life.

629
00:35:37,991 --> 00:35:40,693
She separated us.

630
00:35:45,966 --> 00:35:47,700
She tore us apart.

631
00:35:50,003 --> 00:35:51,537
But,

632
00:35:51,539 --> 00:35:53,106
now, we're together.

633
00:35:53,108 --> 00:35:54,507
No, we're not.

634
00:35:54,509 --> 00:35:55,875
You're nothing to me,

635
00:35:55,877 --> 00:35:57,343
just some crazy bitch

636
00:35:57,345 --> 00:36:00,213
wearingmy t-shirt.

637
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,217
"London Calling".

638
00:36:25,172 --> 00:36:28,241
Scientists made one little baby

639
00:36:28,243 --> 00:36:30,076
and then we split in two.

640
00:36:36,518 --> 00:36:39,085
So I cannot kill you,

641
00:36:39,087 --> 00:36:40,086
sister.

642
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:44,424
Like you could not kill me.

643
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:53,433
Sarah.

644
00:36:53,435 --> 00:36:56,669
We make a family, yes?

645
00:36:56,671 --> 00:36:58,538
I've already got a family.

646
00:37:36,814 --> 00:37:39,214
Okay,moment of truth.

647
00:37:45,455 --> 00:37:48,324
324b21.

648
00:37:48,326 --> 00:37:50,059
It's your I.D. tag.You cracked it.

649
00:37:50,061 --> 00:37:52,461
Let's see what else there is.

650
00:37:52,463 --> 00:37:53,662
Okay,

651
00:37:53,664 --> 00:37:54,897
CAGT...

652
00:37:54,899 --> 00:37:56,498
GT...

653
00:38:00,938 --> 00:38:03,305
Rachel Duncan.

654
00:38:03,307 --> 00:38:04,406
It's Sarah.

655
00:38:05,942 --> 00:38:07,609
Yes, Sarah?

656
00:38:07,611 --> 00:38:10,179
I wantto know my daughter

657
00:38:10,181 --> 00:38:12,114
won't have to live like this.

658
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:14,984
We can do that.

659
00:38:14,986 --> 00:38:16,619
I'm coming in.

660
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:06,235
One down, two to go.

661
00:39:10,741 --> 00:39:12,174
What's going on over there?

662
00:39:12,176 --> 00:39:16,112
Oh!

663
00:39:16,114 --> 00:39:18,447
None of our business.

664
00:39:20,084 --> 00:39:21,317
Your tracksuit!

665
00:39:21,319 --> 00:39:22,718
Mm-hmm.

666
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,054
I'm going for a jog.

667
00:39:25,056 --> 00:39:26,889
I've been a lump.You deserve better.

668
00:39:26,891 --> 00:39:28,558
Hmm.

669
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,159
I feel like a weighthas been lifted.

670
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:39,569
- All right.- Okay.

671
00:39:39,571 --> 00:39:41,637
- Here we go.- Bye. Have fun.

672
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:43,072
- See you in a bit.- Be safe.

673
00:39:43,074 --> 00:39:44,540
I will.

674
00:40:00,057 --> 00:40:02,825
Going up.

675
00:40:10,934 --> 00:40:11,934
Sarah.

676
00:40:11,936 --> 00:40:13,669
Don't!

677
00:40:17,474 --> 00:40:18,841
You asked me

678
00:40:18,843 --> 00:40:21,611
what happened in Afghanistan.

679
00:40:21,613 --> 00:40:23,379
I was a private contractor.

680
00:40:23,381 --> 00:40:25,481
I killed six marines.

681
00:40:25,483 --> 00:40:27,750
Friendly fire.

682
00:40:27,752 --> 00:40:31,120
They covered it up.

683
00:40:31,122 --> 00:40:32,622
That's what they have on me.

684
00:40:32,624 --> 00:40:35,791
If you were bornoutside their control,

685
00:40:35,793 --> 00:40:38,227
what do theyreally have on you?

686
00:40:53,944 --> 00:40:55,110
Yeah?

687
00:40:55,112 --> 00:40:56,879
Sarah,you can't make a deal.

688
00:40:56,881 --> 00:40:58,213
Why not?

689
00:40:58,215 --> 00:41:01,216
Any freedom they promiseis bullshit.

690
00:41:01,218 --> 00:41:02,651
They're liars.

691
00:41:02,653 --> 00:41:04,019
That synthetic sequence,

692
00:41:04,021 --> 00:41:05,687
the barcode I told you about?

693
00:41:05,689 --> 00:41:08,023
It's a patent.

694
00:41:08,025 --> 00:41:09,324
A patent?

695
00:41:09,326 --> 00:41:11,360
We're property.

696
00:41:11,362 --> 00:41:14,630
Our bodies, our biology,

697
00:41:14,632 --> 00:41:17,399
everything we are,everything we become,

698
00:41:17,401 --> 00:41:19,301
belongs to them.

699
00:41:19,303 --> 00:41:21,937
Sarah, they could claim Kira.

700
00:41:25,075 --> 00:41:27,443
They patented us.

701
00:41:55,672 --> 00:41:58,006
Back on track, I think.

702
00:41:58,008 --> 00:42:00,876
It's the7-year itch.

703
00:42:00,878 --> 00:42:03,112
It's not easy.

704
00:42:03,114 --> 00:42:05,881
She's not easy.

705
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:24,501
_

706
00:42:38,648 --> 00:42:40,782
You know what to do.

707
00:42:40,784 --> 00:42:43,819
"This organism

708
00:42:43,821 --> 00:42:46,555
and derivative genetic material

709
00:42:46,557 --> 00:42:49,024
is restrictedintellectual property".

710
00:42:56,166 --> 00:42:58,100
I'm sick, Delphine.

711
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:30,032
Siobhan!

712
00:43:30,034 --> 00:43:32,201
Kira!

713
00:43:45,481 --> 00:43:48,684
Kira-a-a!
