자거라

27
00:01:53,715 --> 00:01:56,049
그래, 살인자는 아직도살아있는거네

28
00:01:56,117 --> 00:01:58,818
그래, 아마도 우리를 쫓도록그앨 보낸 곳으로 기어들어갔겠지

29
00:01:58,886 --> 00:02:02,088
경찰짓하던거꼭 관둬야 했던거야?

30
00:02:02,156 --> 00:02:04,090
그게 무슨 도움이 되겠어앨리슨, 전화한건

EEG 헬멧, 뇌내전기적 활동을 감시하는 거지

79
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,086
그렇담 지랄맞은 꿈을 꾼게아니란거네, 그치?

80
00:07:59,154 --> 00:08:01,222
이럴 줄 알았어저기, 내가 얼마나

81
00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:04,125
얘기 했었어? 우린 불법 실험에실험실 생쥐 꼴이라니까

82
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,628
사라, 그러는 동안에폴은 어딨었어?

83
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,863
어.. 그중에 둘 셋은

89
00:08:19,741 --> 00:08:21,675
대상물 가까이에관찰자를 두었을꺼야..

90
00:08:21,743 --> 00:08:26,379
그찮아, 누군가는 색인표를 달고데이터를 모아야지

91
00:08:26,447 --> 00:08:28,949
코지마..나한테 무슨 짓을 한걸까?

92
00:08:29,017 --> 00:08:31,086
내 생각엔 그들이 뭔가진짜로..

93
00:08:31,087 --> 00:08:33,853
음, 칼을 댔다던지 하면너도 알았을꺼야

이런 젠장할말이 그렇단 거지, 음

95
00:08:35,956 --> 00:08:38,190
EEG는 뇌활동 측정같은거고

96
00:08:38,258 --> 00:08:42,662
팔에 있는 자국으로 봐선.. 혈액표본 채취했을꺼야

97
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:45,097
분석을 위한거 같에폴도 끼어있는거야?

98
00:08:45,165 --> 00:08:47,165
모르겠어왜?

99
00:08:47,232 --> 00:08:50,068
너랑 같이 잤다고 그런거야?피

100
00:08:54,574 --> 00:08:56,975

너 베스 남자친구랑잔거야?

103
00:09:05,817 --> 00:09:07,718
난 그럴리가 없겠지만

104
00:09:09,921 --> 00:09:12,990
나도 어쩜 감시자하고자고 있을지도 모르겠다

105
00:09:13,058 --> 00:09:15,759
부탁한 총 저기 뒀어난 가야겠어

106
00:09:15,827 --> 00:09:18,095
이봐, 이봐돈은 어딨어?

107
00:09:18,162 --> 00:09:20,096
뭐에 쓰려고?

108
00:09:20,163 --> 00:09:22,966
우리 보호 기금이잖아아니야?

109
00:09:23,033 --> 00:09:26,186
지난 번 확인했을 때,우릴 보호하는건 나 하나 뿐이고

110
00:09:32,351 --> 00:09:34,388
2만 달러야

111
00:09:35,678 --> 00:09:38,080
제발 현명하게 써줘

00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,719
폴 그 자식 알을쏴버리겠어

114
00:09:43,786 --> 00:09:45,787
잠깐, 그냥, 음..비틀어버리기만 해, 알았지?

115
00:09:45,855 --> 00:09:47,889
이 모든 일에우릴 데려다 줄꺼야

116
00:09:47,957 --> 00:09:50,725
하지만, 만약내 눈먼 실험물이 갑자기..

117
00:09:50,792 --> 00:09:55,763
자각을 하게되면, 이것 또한유레카적 순간이지만..

118
00:09:57,035 --> 00:09:57,932
그래?

119
00:09:57,933 --> 00:10:00,635
나라면 폐기하겠어그러니까..

120
00:10:00,702 --> 00:10:03,189
조심해, 알았지?

00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:45,609
그렇단건 걔도 폴을의심하고 있었던거네

137
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,112

00:10:57,555 --> 00:10:59,489
저기당신이 얘기했잖소!

143

상황이 더 악화되면다른 방법은 뭐가 있죠?

144
00:11:02,626 --> 00:11:04,283
당신 뭐하는 거야?

00:11:04,613 --> 00:11:05,662
나중에 다시 전화할께

146
00:11:05,663 --> 00:11:07,831
다..당신 왜내 화장대 뒤지는거야?

147
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:10,300
그게.. 가위 찾느라

148
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:18,540
당신 누구랑통화한거야?

149
00:11:18,608 --> 00:11:20,203
방금 말야?

150

152
00:11:26,508 --> 00:11:27,915
당신도 알잖아

153
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,651
오, 잘됐다. 음이 상표 좀 잘라줄레?

154

내 질문 하나 할까?너 어떻게 한거지?

506
00:35:42,293 --> 00:35:45,061

이번이 우리가 해답을얻을 기회야

539
00:38:12,234 --> 00:38:14,001
놈이 키아라까지쫓아왔어, 코즈

540
00:38:14,068 --> 00:38:16,903
알아, 안다고그래도, 널 감싸주기도 했지

541
00:38:16,971 --> 00:38:19,440
맞지? 그 올리비에란 작자뭐 잘못된거 있는지 물었는데

542
00:38:19,508 --> 00:38:21,208
폴은 없다고 그랬어왜일까?

543
00:38:21,276 --> 00:38:25,811
그야 녀석이 가짜 베스한테빠져들고 있어서겠지

544
00:38:25,879 --> 00:38:27,413
그래! 끝내주잖아! 그건..

545
00:38:27,481 --> 00:38:29,415
니가 이용하면 된다고내가 어쩌다가

546
00:38:29,483 --> 00:38:31,451
이 진창에 처음 발을들여놓게 됐는데, 어?

547
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:33,520
좋아, 알았어열 좀 식히고

548
00:38:33,587 --> 00:38:38,424
올리비에란 작자가 녀석을굴리는거 같은데, 이건 꼭

549
00:38:38,492 --> 00:38:41,326
이중 눈속임 같거든너 뭘 얘기하려는건데?

550
00:38:41,394 --> 00:38:43,395
그들이 폴한테도숨기는게 있다고

551
00:38:43,463 --> 00:38:45,831
맞아? 그러니 녀석도실험결과에 손을 못 대고

552
00:38:47,701 --> 00:38:50,069
그 자식도 자기가 감시하는게복제인간인지 모른단거야?

553
00:38:50,137 --> 00:38:51,570
그래, 그렇지

554
00:38:51,638 --> 00:38:53,639
하지만 올리비에는확실히 알아

555
00:38:53,707 --> 00:38:56,141
알았어? 그자가 바로우리가 잡아야되는 놈이야

556
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,624
내가 폴부터 먼저처리하면 안될까?

557
00:38:57,744 --> 00:38:58,616
사라?

558
00:39:13,792 --> 00:39:15,225
난 쇼파에서 잘께

559
00:39:15,293 --> 00:39:16,927
도니, 도니, 도니..

560
00:39:18,496 --> 00:39:20,630
당신이 맞아

561
00:39:20,699 --> 00:39:23,200
다들 사생활이필요하지

562
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,563
이리와

563
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:50,959
네 권총은 반납한줄 알았는데어?

564
00:39:51,027 --> 00:39:52,694
왼쪽 자켓 주머니

565
00:39:52,762 --> 00:39:54,229
내려놔

566
00:39:54,296 --> 00:39:57,599
저기, 나한테스토커가 붙었나본데

567
00:40:00,568 --> 00:40:01,694
앉아

568
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,441
그건 탁자에 놓고

569
00:40:13,648 --> 00:40:14,861
알고 있었어

570
00:40:15,549 --> 00:40:18,351
딱 집어내진 못했지만알고는 있었어

571
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:21,520
네가 청문회 하기로했었던 날이였지

572
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:24,457
몇 달만에 처음으로 우리 섹스하고뭐가? 당신이 그리웠던거야

573
00:40:24,524 --> 00:40:26,726
넌 그 크래쉬 티셔츠를입고 있었어

574
00:40:26,794 --> 00:40:29,328
나는 꼭.. 뭐야?

575
00:40:29,396 --> 00:40:32,765
그러더니, 쿵, 넌 나랑바로 저 조리대에서 했지

576
00:40:32,832 --> 00:40:35,768
불만있는거야, 폴?무..무슨 얘길 하는거야?

577
00:40:35,835 --> 00:40:37,535
생각하던거 조차도

578
00:40:37,603 --> 00:40:39,972
거부하더니니가 밀어붙인거야

579
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:41,586
나 요즘 어땠는지너도 알잖아

580
00:40:41,706 --> 00:40:44,877
그러더니 니 목에 있던 상처가사라졌더라고, 뭐 때문일까?

581
00:40:44,944 --> 00:40:46,611
무슨 크림?

582
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:48,512
그리고 이 번엔..

583
00:40:52,584 --> 00:40:54,385
이 꼬마 여자애

584
00:40:55,676 --> 00:40:57,755
난 베스가 아이를가질 수 없다는걸

585
00:40:57,823 --> 00:40:59,859
알았을 때곁에 있었어

586
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:02,893
그럼 이 여자앤 뭐지?

587
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:07,297

00:41:10,437 --> 00:41:13,321
정신나간거야?내가?

590
00:41:13,366 --> 00:41:15,772
그, 내가 오늘옛날 비디오를 좀 봤지

591
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,641
니가 단축 마라톤을준비할 때였지

592
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:21,043
니가 마지막으로 참가했던경기가 뭐였지?

593
00:41:23,464 --> 00:41:25,281
어느 도시에서 열린거지?

594
00:41:31,888 --> 00:41:33,697
베스 어딨어?

595
00:41:39,428 --> 00:41:41,167
이게 마지막이야

596
00:41:43,105 --> 00:41:45,278
니가 누구던지 간에..

597
00:41:45,346 --> 00:41:47,280
베스는 어딨어?

598
00:41:47,348 --> 00:41:49,334
그애 자살했어

599
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,520
기차 앞으로뛰어들었지

600
00:41:53,488 --> 00:41:55,074
넌 영국인이네

601
00:41:55,294 --> 00:41:56,709
넌 누구야?

602
00:41:56,979 --> 00:41:58,492
난 걔 쌍둥이야

603
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:00,337
쌍둥이?

604
00:42:01,194 --> 00:42:03,129
무슨 시험하는거야?

605
00:42:03,196 --> 00:42:04,898
무슨 시험 말야?

606
00:42:04,965 --> 00:42:06,933
베스한테자매는 없어

607
00:42:08,205 --> 00:42:09,526
니 이름이 뭐야?

608
00:42:09,592 --> 00:42:10,671
사라

609
00:42:11,023 --> 00:42:12,639
사라 뭐?

610
00:42:12,706 --> 00:42:14,766
사라면 충분하잖아

611
00:42:15,675 --> 00:42:18,343
베스가 죽고서내가 걔 신분을 챙겼어

612
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:20,412
베스는 죽지 않았어

613
00:42:22,481 --> 00:42:25,784
이봐, 난 걔 은행계좌만챙겨가려고 했던거야

614
00:42:25,852 --> 00:42:28,787
너랑 얽히려던 생각은전혀 없었다고

615
00:42:28,855 --> 00:42:31,556
정말 그애가 죽었다면니가 죽이지 않았단걸 어떻게 알아?

616
00:42:31,623 --> 00:42:34,458
니가 그앨 죽였으니까뭐라고?

00:42:34,526 --> 00:42:36,727
너가 걔 감시자잖아아니야?

618
00:42:36,795 --> 00:42:38,729
그래서 그게 뭐?

619
00:42:38,797 --> 00:42:40,531
니가 걜 관찰했지

620
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:43,267
니가 사람들을집에 들였고

621
00:42:43,334 --> 00:42:45,036
어제밤 처럼

622
00:42:47,104 --> 00:42:50,607
의사들이 와서 그 애가잠든 동안 의학실험을 했지

623
00:42:50,675 --> 00:42:52,676
그 애도 알았어

624
00:42:59,083 --> 00:43:02,485
넌 심어진거잖아또, 그 애가 자살한건

625
00:43:02,553 --> 00:43:06,589
자기가 사랑했던 남자가자기 삶 전부를 거짓으로 만들어버렸으니까

626
00:43:06,656 --> 00:43:09,091
니가 자길 사랑하지 않는걸 알았지만니가 왜 떠나지 않는지는

627
00:43:09,158 --> 00:43:12,561
이해하지 못했지그리고는 그애도 알게된거야

628
00:43:12,629 --> 00:43:14,463
그럴리 없어

629
00:43:16,365 --> 00:43:19,266
이건 시험이야

630
00:43:19,334 --> 00:43:21,736
안그래?

631
00:43:21,804 --> 00:43:24,205
아니냐고?

632
00:43:24,272 --> 00:43:26,741
그 앤 널 믿었어

633
00:43:26,809 --> 00:43:29,644
그 애한테어떻게 그럴 수 있지?

634
00:43:35,984 --> 00:43:38,251
나라고 방법이있었을거 같에?

635
00:43:39,969 --> 00:43:41,950
왜인지만 말해줘

636
00:43:43,337 --> 00:43:45,892
우리한텐왜인지 말을 안해주거든

637
00:00:05,263 --> 00:00:06,360
We're clones.

638
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,799
We're someone's experimentand they're killing us off!

639
00:00:08,919 --> 00:00:10,425
I'm not Beth.

640
00:00:12,386 --> 00:00:14,920
Beth was on this killer'shit list and, now, I am.

641
00:00:14,988 --> 00:00:17,757
Someone is covering up their illegalexperiments by wiping us out.

642
00:00:17,824 --> 00:00:20,692
If Sarah misses tonight, thenshe may never get Kira back.

643
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,262
She want me to impersonate herin front of her daughter?

644
00:00:23,329 --> 00:00:25,531
- You're not my mother.- I'm sorry about this,

645
00:00:25,598 --> 00:00:28,200
but it's very importantthat you keep this a secret.

646
00:00:28,268 --> 00:00:31,270
If that was my boyfriend, I'djust in front of a train too.

647
00:00:31,337 --> 00:00:32,904
Something's different.

648
00:00:35,006 --> 00:00:38,342
- Everything all right here?- Does she seem all right to you?

649
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:41,179
Look, we need to spend sometime together, figure out what's

650
00:00:41,246 --> 00:00:43,847
suddenly going on with us,because most of it I like a lot.

651
00:00:43,915 --> 00:00:46,116
Sarah blindsided me,then she took off with the coke.

652
00:00:46,185 --> 00:00:48,046
I'm on the hook with Pouchy!

653
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:49,701
Maggie helped make you.

654
00:00:49,821 --> 00:00:51,655
Beth killed her to protect us.

655
00:00:51,723 --> 00:00:54,424
We have a connection.Can you feel it?

656
00:00:54,492 --> 00:00:57,094
Go. Run!

657
00:01:02,867 --> 00:01:04,902
I quit.

658
00:01:32,661 --> 00:01:35,997
- Shh. Shh, shh, shh.- Tomas.

659
00:01:36,065 --> 00:01:39,166
Easy now.

660
00:01:39,234 --> 00:01:41,802
Sleep, child.

661
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,570
Sleep.

662
00:01:53,715 --> 00:01:56,049
So, the killer'sstill out there.

663
00:01:56,117 --> 00:01:58,818
Yeah, probably crawled back to thefreak that sent her after us.

664
00:01:58,886 --> 00:02:02,088
Did you have to quitbeing a cop?

665
00:02:02,156 --> 00:02:04,090
- How can that help?- Alison, this isn't

666
00:02:04,158 --> 00:02:07,727
why I called.I want to thank you

667
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:09,295
for helping with Kira.

668
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:10,830
Oh.

00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:19,272

672
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:35,119

673
00:03:16,892 --> 00:03:18,960
- Hey!- Beth! Stop, it's me!

674
00:03:19,028 --> 00:03:22,931
- Oh, my God. You asshole!- You'd stab me in the eye with a nail file?

675
00:03:22,998 --> 00:03:27,402
Yeah, you sneak up on me in the shower, I amgonna stab you in the eye with a nail file!

676
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,004

I didn't mean to scare you.I'm sorry.

678
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:36,009
How sorry are you?

679

Uh, no thanks.

00:07:01,533 --> 00:07:03,868
How you feeling?

705
00:07:03,936 --> 00:07:05,437
What?

706
00:07:08,907 --> 00:07:12,543
No gun, no badge,nowhere to be.

707
00:07:12,611 --> 00:07:15,480
- Mm-hmm.- Let's leave.

708
00:07:15,547 --> 00:07:17,682
We don't have any ties.

709
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:20,317
I have three simple wordsfor you:

710
00:07:20,385 --> 00:07:23,488
- Paul.- Rio de Janeiro.

711
00:07:23,555 --> 00:07:26,890
I can't just leave nowand think about going to Rio.

712
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:29,125
Why not?

713
00:07:29,193 --> 00:07:32,061
It's what you wanted, right?Commitment. I'm ready.

714
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:36,366
No, I can't thinkabout this right now.

715
00:07:36,433 --> 00:07:38,407
- What's wrong?- Nothing's wrong.

716
00:07:38,527 --> 00:07:39,550
You're shaking like a leaf.

717
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:42,405
- Where are you going?- I'm just going out for some air.

718
00:07:42,473 --> 00:07:44,773
Ok?

719
00:07:47,377 --> 00:07:51,013
It's an electrode froman electroencephalogram array

720
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,848
a what?

721
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:56,752
An EEG helmet. It monitorselectrical activity in the brain.

722
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,086
So it wasn't a bloody dream,then, was it?

723
00:07:59,154 --> 00:08:01,222
I knew it.Well, how long

724
00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:04,125
have I been saying this? We're likelab rats in an illegal experiment.

725
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,628
Sarah, where was Paulduring all this?

726
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,863
Uh... there were doctors,

727
00:08:08,931 --> 00:08:11,533
um, two or three of them.He could be

728
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,801
in on it, though.Maybe he set it up.

729
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:16,904
Well, somebody must be watchingthe lab rats... someone we know.

730
00:08:16,971 --> 00:08:19,673
Well, I mean, if it weremy experiment, yeah, I would

731
00:08:19,741 --> 00:08:21,675
Put an observerclose to the subject...

732
00:08:21,743 --> 00:08:26,379
You know, somebody to keep tabsand accumulate data.

733
00:08:26,447 --> 00:08:28,949
Cosima...What'd they do to me?

734
00:08:29,017 --> 00:08:30,683
I think you'd know

735
00:08:30,751 --> 00:08:33,853
if they'd done anythingreally... um, invasive.

736
00:08:33,921 --> 00:08:35,888
- Oh, my God.-  I'm just saying, um,

737
00:08:35,956 --> 00:08:38,190
An EEG is likea neurological test,

738
00:08:38,258 --> 00:08:42,662
and that mark on your arm lookslike... a blood sample.

739
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:45,097
- It sounds diagnostic.- With Paul in on it?

740
00:08:45,165 --> 00:08:47,165
- I don't know.- Why?

741
00:08:47,232 --> 00:08:50,068
- Just 'cause he slept with you?- Fee.

742
00:08:54,574 --> 00:08:56,975
Yeah, we sort ofended up shagging.

743
00:08:57,043 --> 00:09:00,244
Dude, that's complex.

744
00:09:00,312 --> 00:09:03,881
You sleptwith Beth's boyfriend?

745
00:09:03,949 --> 00:09:05,749
Oh.

746
00:09:05,817 --> 00:09:07,718
Far be it from me.

747
00:09:09,921 --> 00:09:12,990
I may be sleepingwith my spy as well.

748
00:09:13,058 --> 00:09:15,759
There's the gun you wanted.I've gotta go.

749
00:09:15,827 --> 00:09:18,095
Hey, hey, where's the money?

750
00:09:18,162 --> 00:09:20,096
What's it for?

751
00:09:20,163 --> 00:09:22,966
It's the self-defense fund,yeah?

752
00:09:23,033 --> 00:09:26,669
Last time I checked,I'm the only one defending us.

753
00:09:31,842 --> 00:09:35,611
Here's 20,000.

754
00:09:35,678 --> 00:09:38,080
Please use it wisely.

755
00:09:38,147 --> 00:09:41,382
Yeah, I'll bring youthe receipt.

756
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,719
I am gonna shootPaul's balls off.

757
00:09:43,786 --> 00:09:45,787
Wait, just, um,just squeeze them, ok?

758
00:09:45,855 --> 00:09:47,889
He's our wayinto this whole thing.

759
00:09:47,957 --> 00:09:50,725
But if my blind subject weresuddenly to become...

760
00:09:50,792 --> 00:09:55,763
Self-aware, it'd either bea Eureka moment or...

761
00:09:55,831 --> 00:09:57,865
Yeah?

762
00:09:57,933 --> 00:10:00,635
I would terminate, so...

763
00:10:00,702 --> 00:10:04,404
- Be careful, ok?- On that note...

764
00:10:06,741 --> 00:10:09,009
Shit.

765
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:12,245
- Cop station. Third time today.- No, don't answer that.

766
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:15,348
- Uh, Art, what do you want?- It's Raj.

767
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:17,350
Mmm...

768
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:20,120
I'm off the force, Raj.

769
00:10:20,187 --> 00:10:22,421
I know. You ok?

770
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:24,389
- Yeah.- Ok, well, you know

771
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,391
That surveillance shitthat I lent you?

772
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,426
I'm gonna need that backbefore they inventory.

773
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:31,329
Surveillance shit?Right. Right.

774
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:32,965
And, Beth, level with me.

775
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:34,967
This is just about Paul,right?

776
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:38,170
Look, I'll get back to youin a couple days, ok?

777
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:43,007
So, Beth hadsurveillance equipment.

778
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:45,609
So then she was on to Paul too.

779
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,112
did she find anything?

780
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,681
It's critical.

781
00:10:49,748 --> 00:10:52,283
One week she's fine,the next it's armageddon.

782
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:55,652
No, I understand that,but I don't want to give her

783
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,487
any reason to react.

784
00:10:57,555 --> 00:10:59,489
Well, you tell me!

785
00:10:59,557 --> 00:11:02,559
If it gets any worse,what are our options?

786
00:11:02,626 --> 00:11:05,595
- What are you doing?- I have to call you back.

787
00:11:05,663 --> 00:11:07,831
Why... why were youin my vanity?

788
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:10,300
I need... scissors.

789
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:18,540
Who were you talking to?

790
00:11:18,608 --> 00:11:20,609
- Just now?- Mm-hmm.

791
00:11:20,677 --> 00:11:23,545
- Uh, Big Rich, from work.- About me?

792
00:11:23,613 --> 00:11:26,015
About Susan Teller.She's all over us this quarter.

793
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,183
You know that.

794
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,651
Oh, good. Um, can youcut this tag off?

795
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,721
It's driving me crazy.

796
00:11:36,058 --> 00:11:38,093
Much better.

797
00:11:44,933 --> 00:11:47,500
All right, what do we doif he walks in?

798
00:11:47,568 --> 00:11:48,969
Shoot him.

799
00:11:49,037 --> 00:11:50,503
I'm kidding.

800
00:11:50,571 --> 00:11:54,141
Just... find the surveillancestuff, yeah?

801
00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:56,977
And put everything backwhere you found it.

802
00:11:57,045 --> 00:11:59,511
This place is antiseptic.

803
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:03,122
Paul's whole world feels fakenow.

804
00:12:04,049 --> 00:12:05,083
What?

805
00:12:05,203 --> 00:12:08,039
I don't leave printswhen I burgle.

806
00:12:18,364 --> 00:12:20,431
Trexcom Consulting.

807
00:12:25,171 --> 00:12:28,240
If, uh, fake Paul wasobserving Beth,

808
00:12:28,307 --> 00:12:30,875
what makes you so certain noone's observing Sarah Manning?

809
00:12:30,942 --> 00:12:35,212
Who? Mrs. S hates me.I haven't seen her in a year.

810
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,982
And I'm giving you the benefitof the doubt.

811
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,050
A ringing vote of confidence.

812
00:12:43,121 --> 00:12:45,555
Nothing on Beth's computer.Nothing.

813
00:12:45,623 --> 00:12:49,893
No audio files, no video,no transcripts.

814
00:12:53,563 --> 00:12:55,364
Holy shit.

815
00:12:55,432 --> 00:12:57,901
Hey, hey. Hey.

816
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,144
He's military.

817
00:13:13,383 --> 00:13:16,885
Looks like you're notthe only one keeping secrets.

818
00:13:16,953 --> 00:13:18,487
What are those?

819
00:13:18,555 --> 00:13:20,121
Letters from Beth.

820
00:13:20,189 --> 00:13:22,457
- To Paul? I want to read them.- Uh, uh, uh.

821
00:13:22,525 --> 00:13:24,292
No, they're private.

822
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,262
Where the hell isthis surveillance stuff?

823
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,731
Don't know.We've searched everywhere.

824
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,242
There we go.

825
00:13:45,046 --> 00:13:47,347
She wasn't messing around,was she?

826
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,484
Maybe it's timeto find out where Paul works.

827
00:13:51,552 --> 00:13:53,820
Oh, yeah.Trexcom Consulting.

828
00:13:53,888 --> 00:13:55,822
Fake Paul, fake company.

829
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:58,057
I bet you moneythere's nothing there.

830
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,414
No way.

831
00:14:29,858 --> 00:14:31,926
Beth.

832
00:14:32,693 --> 00:14:34,628
We downsized, remember?

833
00:14:34,695 --> 00:14:36,496
Paul's office is over here now.

834
00:14:36,564 --> 00:14:39,432
Oh, right.

835
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,333
Yeah, of course.

836
00:14:41,401 --> 00:14:43,001
He's in a meeting.

837
00:14:43,069 --> 00:14:45,971
Oh. Y... you know what,

838
00:14:46,038 --> 00:14:49,341
um... we kinda got into itthis morning.

839
00:14:49,409 --> 00:14:51,510
I brought up some lunchas a peace offering.

840
00:14:51,578 --> 00:14:53,345
Come on.

841
00:15:12,665 --> 00:15:14,097
I'll just...

842
00:15:14,165 --> 00:15:15,666
Sure.

843
00:15:44,661 --> 00:15:46,828
Big Boob Blowies?

844
00:16:04,312 --> 00:16:05,779
Felix, I hope

845
00:16:05,847 --> 00:16:07,948
you can hear this. Yes! Yeah, I can.

846
00:16:08,015 --> 00:16:11,017
Now, you silly bitch, would youget your fanny out of there?

- Beth, this morning... - You want to talk about it?

850
00:17:00,465 --> 00:17:02,800
I'd rather talkabout last night

851
00:17:02,868 --> 00:17:05,335

852
00:17:05,403 --> 00:17:08,170
I came to bring you lunch,that's all.

853
00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:13,877
Something's changed with us.

854
00:17:13,944 --> 00:17:15,879
Mmm.

855
00:17:15,946 --> 00:17:18,014
I know you can feel it.

856
00:17:19,983 --> 00:17:22,451
What happened to your scar?

857
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:24,085
What?

858
00:17:24,153 --> 00:17:26,422
The scar on your neck from the mountain bike crash.

859
00:17:26,489 --> 00:17:27,923
It's gone.

860
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,526
Oh. Really?

861
00:17:32,495 --> 00:17:34,696
I-I'm using a new lotion.

862
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,434
Let me see.

863
00:17:39,501 --> 00:17:41,636
You will try anything,won't you?

864
00:17:41,703 --> 00:17:43,370
I will.

865
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,443
But I gotta get back to work.

866
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,545
Thanks for lunch.

867
00:17:52,548 --> 00:17:54,648

Clear my afternoon, ok?

870
00:18:36,421 --> 00:18:39,457
- Something came up. - Shit.

871
00:18:49,266 --> 00:18:51,502
Alison, what are you doing?

872
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,041
Uh...

873
00:18:59,109 --> 00:19:00,309
What's in the box, Donnie?

874
00:19:00,377 --> 00:19:02,044
It's private.

875
00:19:02,112 --> 00:19:05,615
No, it isn't!What... what is in it?

876
00:19:05,682 --> 00:19:08,918
- Donnie, what's in the box?- I am entitled to a little privacy,

877
00:19:08,986 --> 00:19:12,021
- even in this house.- Oh, that's rich coming from you.

878
00:19:12,088 --> 00:19:15,289
- What hell is that supposed to mean?- Open the box, Donnie!

879
00:19:15,357 --> 00:19:18,192
- Give it to me!- Open it!

880
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,129
Alison... Alison, stop it!

881
00:19:42,017 --> 00:19:45,218
Yeah, blood looks fine.No infection.

882
00:19:45,286 --> 00:19:47,018
What kind of symptomsare we talking about?

883
00:19:47,138 --> 00:19:50,924
Um... shortness of breath,coughing up blood...

884
00:19:50,991 --> 00:19:52,792
That sort of thing.

885
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:57,630
- Who's the subject?- Uh, subjects, and if I told you that,

886
00:19:57,698 --> 00:20:00,733
- I'd have to kill you.- Ha! Ha...

887
00:20:00,801 --> 00:20:03,635
Ha! Ha! Um, can you run

888
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,604
a PCR on these samples,see if there are any

889
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:07,940
- genetic markers?- You're thinking...

890
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:09,942
Antitrypsin deficiency?Cystic fibrosis?

891
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:11,710
Yeah, that kind of thing.

892
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:14,846
And, um, can you sequencefor Cytochrome C?

893
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:17,148
- The barcode gene?- Mm-hmm.

894
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,617
That's the one we usefor species differentiation.

895
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:21,086
Is it?

896
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,855
What's in it for me?

897
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:30,094
Um, how about you getto have sex... with yourself?

898
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:34,065
Aw-awesome deal.

899
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:40,137
Arrete. Arrete, je te dis.

900
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:41,972
C'est difficile pour moi aussi.

901
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:43,673
Oui.

902
00:20:43,741 --> 00:20:46,042
Non, non. Tu ne peux pas venir ici, parce...

903
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:49,545
Parce... parce que j'aidu boulot, parce que... allez.

904
00:20:49,614 --> 00:20:52,882
Allez, il faut que j'y aille.

905
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,053
I'm sorry.

906
00:21:31,285 --> 00:21:34,121
He's a bastard.

907
00:21:34,188 --> 00:21:35,756
Who?

908
00:21:35,823 --> 00:21:38,892
Paul. Beth loved him,

909
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,461
but he wouldn't love her backand he wouldn't leave her.

910
00:21:41,529 --> 00:21:45,798
Mm. Well, he's certainlychanged his tune now, hasn't he?

911
00:21:45,866 --> 00:21:47,900
Sarah, he's falling for you.

912
00:21:47,968 --> 00:21:49,401
God, what a mess.

913
00:21:52,639 --> 00:21:54,573
I'm outside Kira's school.

914
00:21:56,176 --> 00:21:58,177
Of all the things that scare meright now, Fee,

915
00:21:58,244 --> 00:22:00,479

00:22:00,547 --> 00:22:02,580
- to see you, right?- Yeah, thanks.

917
00:22:02,648 --> 00:22:05,684
She's the only thingthat really matters, you know?

- So glad you could step away.- From the morgue?

921
00:22:19,831 --> 00:22:24,201
Uh, trust me, scheduling isn'treally an issue.

922
00:22:37,948 --> 00:22:40,116
Hi.

923
00:22:40,184 --> 00:22:43,152
It's me this time.

I know.

925
00:22:54,296 --> 00:22:56,264
God, I missed you so much.

926
00:22:56,332 --> 00:22:57,999
I missed you too.

927
00:23:00,502 --> 00:23:02,437
Why are you wearingsuch fancy clothes?

928
00:23:02,504 --> 00:23:04,906
Ah...

929
00:23:04,974 --> 00:23:07,341
You don't miss a thing,do you?

930
00:23:11,312 --> 00:23:13,513
Are you ok, mommy?

931
00:23:13,581 --> 00:23:15,750
Yeah.

932
00:23:15,817 --> 00:23:17,417
I am now.

933
00:23:17,485 --> 00:23:18,719
God, you're so big.

934
00:23:18,787 --> 00:23:20,755
I'm the smallest kidin my class.

935
00:23:22,957 --> 00:23:25,859
Well, you're big to me.

936
00:23:25,926 --> 00:23:28,695
How come you never told meabout Auntie Alison?

937
00:23:28,763 --> 00:23:30,697
I didn't know her.

938
00:23:30,765 --> 00:23:32,699
She looks just like you.

939
00:23:32,767 --> 00:23:34,901
Yeah.

940
00:23:34,969 --> 00:23:38,904
One day, I'll explain it allto you. Yeah, monkey?

941
00:23:38,972 --> 00:23:41,940
Is someone tryingto hurt us?

942
00:23:42,008 --> 00:23:44,209
Why do you ask that?

943
00:23:44,278 --> 00:23:46,812
Alison said you're making surewe're safe.

944
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,349
Hey. Hey.

945
00:23:50,417 --> 00:23:53,051

946
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:56,220
You're safe, Kira.I promise.

947

Um, um, oh, God.I am so sorry.

I'm not usuallylike... like this.

958
00:24:42,432 --> 00:24:44,666
Oh. Bad breakup?

959
00:24:44,734 --> 00:24:48,036
Yeah, well, we'rean ocean apart, so...

960
00:24:48,103 --> 00:24:50,706
Yeah.Long distance never works.

961
00:24:52,642 --> 00:24:56,010
Um, you'rein microbiology too, right?

962
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:59,580

00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,456
Yeah, yeah. That's... that'swhat we call it here.

966
00:25:08,523 --> 00:25:10,658
- Yeah.- Yeah.

00:25:10,726 --> 00:25:13,293
- Delphine.- Cosima.

968
00:25:13,362 --> 00:25:17,196
- Enchantee.- Enchantee.

969
00:25:19,933 --> 00:25:22,068
You're so independent,aren't you?

970
00:25:22,135 --> 00:25:23,670
Hmm, monkey?

971
00:25:23,738 --> 00:25:26,806
- Little monkey?- Remind you of anyone?

972
00:25:26,874 --> 00:25:29,409
Yeah, but I was much angrier,wasn't I?

973
00:25:29,477 --> 00:25:32,711
Even small.

974
00:25:32,779 --> 00:25:35,046
You were the one who introducedme to punk rock, though.

975
00:25:36,983 --> 00:25:39,451
Yeah. You tookall of the attitude,

976
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:41,420
none of the politics.

977
00:25:43,823 --> 00:25:46,924
I'm just happy she doesn't haveto bounce around like I did.

978
00:25:46,992 --> 00:25:50,261
I was her age when I cameto live with you

979
00:25:50,328 --> 00:25:52,497
- in London, yeah?- A little bit older.

980
00:25:52,564 --> 00:25:56,133
Well, you got me this far.

981
00:25:58,404 --> 00:25:59,970
I know that.

982
00:26:02,007 --> 00:26:04,007
I still need your help, though.

983
00:26:04,074 --> 00:26:05,675
Ah.

984
00:26:05,743 --> 00:26:08,678
I need you to tell me, uh...

985
00:26:08,746 --> 00:26:11,047
what you reallyknow about me...

986
00:26:11,115 --> 00:26:12,883
Where I came from.

987
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:16,019
- Why now?- I'm trying to square things away.

988
00:26:16,086 --> 00:26:17,954
For Kira, you know?

989
00:26:18,022 --> 00:26:20,956
You were part of the fostersystem. I took in kids.

990
00:26:21,024 --> 00:26:23,459
You know, I don't knowwho your parents were.

991
00:26:23,527 --> 00:26:26,562
Yeah, I talked to...Family Services

992
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:29,264
in Brixton already,but I just wondered if there's

993
00:26:29,332 --> 00:26:31,600
- anything else.- Is everything ok?

994
00:26:31,668 --> 00:26:33,636
Yeah.

995
00:26:33,703 --> 00:26:36,671
Yeah, I'm fine.

996
00:26:36,739 --> 00:26:38,873
What about Vic?

997
00:26:38,941 --> 00:26:42,844
- Vic still in the picture?- God no.

998
00:26:42,912 --> 00:26:46,548
That much I can promise.Vic is done.

999
00:26:53,087 --> 00:26:55,388
Ok!

1000
00:26:55,457 --> 00:26:58,058
How you doing, boss?Nice to see you,

1001
00:26:58,125 --> 00:26:59,660
Pouchy.

1002
00:26:59,727 --> 00:27:04,698
Pouchy, she jumpedin front of a train.

1003
00:27:04,766 --> 00:27:06,902
I don't even know whyshe did it, all right?

1004
00:27:07,022 --> 00:27:09,234
Sure, we had our ups and downs,but everything was fine.

1005
00:27:09,302 --> 00:27:12,438
She had the coke on her.

1006
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:16,041
So I'm thinking maybe the cops

1007
00:27:16,109 --> 00:27:18,978
have it.Give me one week.

1008
00:27:19,045 --> 00:27:21,614
Pouchy. I'll get you your money.

1009
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:24,312
You say that last week!

1010
00:27:24,432 --> 00:27:26,131
I know. I'm good for it,though. Wait a minute!

1011
00:27:26,251 --> 00:27:28,653
I'm good for it, Pouchy.You know me. Pouchy, please.

Surveillance, please.

1029
00:28:27,634 --> 00:28:30,101
Something small.

1030
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:35,307
You mean something like,uh, this? Wireless, discreet,

1031
00:28:35,374 --> 00:28:37,275
they call it the nanny cam.

1032
00:28:37,343 --> 00:28:39,410
Sometimes the nanny'spinching your valuables;

Uh, I-I don't...

1046
00:29:41,971 --> 00:29:44,838

00:29:44,906 --> 00:29:47,440
- You bitch, you faked it?- You've got the wrong person.

1048
00:29:47,509 --> 00:29:50,744
You faked it, you bitch!How could you do this to me?!

1049
00:29:50,812 --> 00:29:52,379
Sarah, I thought you were dead!

1050
00:29:52,446 --> 00:29:56,850
How could you goddamn do thisto me? Ah! Ahh!

1051

You bitch!

1060
00:30:23,175 --> 00:30:26,377
- Hello. Alison.- I was just assaulted

1061
00:30:26,445 --> 00:30:28,947
By a disgusting thugwho thought I was you.

1062
00:30:29,015 --> 00:30:31,715
- Who? What'd he look like?- I don't know. He was...

1063
00:30:31,783 --> 00:30:33,684
Urban.

1064
00:30:33,752 --> 00:30:35,419
What the hell does that mean?

1065
00:30:35,486 --> 00:30:38,388
Not white, ok?

1066
00:30:38,456 --> 00:30:41,224
Oh, shit. Vic?

1067
00:30:41,292 --> 00:30:43,160
What happened?

1068
00:30:43,227 --> 00:30:45,596
I assaulted him backis what happened.

1069
00:30:45,664 --> 00:30:47,797
Please tell methat's not Kira's father.

1070
00:30:47,865 --> 00:30:50,633
No, no, absolutely not.

1071
00:30:50,701 --> 00:30:54,270
Well, what's going onwith Paul?

1072
00:30:54,337 --> 00:30:56,773
Well, we think Beth was spyingon him.

1073
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,775
We found surveillance gear.

1074
00:30:58,842 --> 00:31:01,110
She never told me about that.

1075
00:31:01,178 --> 00:31:03,612
Is it true? Is he a mole?

1076
00:31:03,713 --> 00:31:05,814
I don't know that yet.

1077
00:31:05,882 --> 00:31:07,816
What's going on with you?

1078
00:31:07,884 --> 00:31:09,417
Nothing, I'm fine.

1079
00:31:09,485 --> 00:31:11,853
Call me when you knowsomething for sure.

1080
00:31:17,827 --> 00:31:19,360
Olivier.

1081
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:22,997
Paul.

1082
00:31:23,065 --> 00:31:26,301
What are you doing here?Is something wrong?

1083
00:31:26,368 --> 00:31:30,071
We need to talk about Beth.

1084
00:31:30,139 --> 00:31:32,073
How was she this morning?

1085
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:33,908
Fine.

1086
00:31:33,976 --> 00:31:35,742
Everything's fine.

1087
00:31:41,782 --> 00:31:45,119
You don't dothis sort of thing much, do you?

1088
00:31:45,186 --> 00:31:48,688
You mean with a live person?

1089
00:31:48,756 --> 00:31:50,190
Oh! Ha!

1090
00:31:50,258 --> 00:31:52,158
Morgue humor.

1091
00:31:52,259 --> 00:31:54,360

1092
00:31:54,428 --> 00:31:56,429

Ok, bye.

1094
00:32:01,301 --> 00:32:02,835
Bye.

1095
00:32:09,475 --> 00:32:11,743
The morgue attendant? Really?

1096
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:14,746
- Can you knock?- Brilliant, Fee.

1097
00:32:14,813 --> 00:32:17,382
Shagging the bloke that weconned into identifying my body.

1098
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:20,585
Colin is the first nice boyI've met in ages.

1099
00:32:20,653 --> 00:32:22,354
What, like six weeks?

1100
00:32:22,421 --> 00:32:25,189

1102
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:31,895
Oh, I'm so sorry. I completely forgetThat your life is always

1103
00:32:31,963 --> 00:32:34,097
- more important than mine.- No, it's just

1104
00:32:34,166 --> 00:32:37,201
way more difficult.Vic is back.

1105
00:32:37,269 --> 00:32:38,802
Oh, shit.

1106
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:42,372
Yeah, he ran into Alison,so he thinks I'm alive.

1107
00:32:42,439 --> 00:32:45,675
I'll figure it out. I'll...I need to know

1108
00:32:45,742 --> 00:32:50,079

1109
00:32:50,147 --> 00:32:53,115
Well, I did record something.

1110
00:33:01,691 --> 00:33:04,072
What are you doing here?Is something wrong?

1111
00:33:04,192 --> 00:33:05,025
This is it.

1112
00:33:05,145 --> 00:33:07,196
We need to talk about Beth.

1113
00:33:07,263 --> 00:33:10,832
- How was she this morning? - Fine. Everything's fine.

1114
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:14,134
Are you still concerned about her mental health?

1115
00:33:14,203 --> 00:33:17,271
No. She's better, certainly better.

1116
00:33:17,339 --> 00:33:21,342
You understand your role as monitor is not to interfere.

1117
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:22,409
Monitor.

1118
00:33:22,529 --> 00:33:24,626

- About what?- I need you to come home.

1127
00:33:44,664 --> 00:33:48,034

Paul followed mestraight to Kira.

1133

Is this a bad time?

1134
00:34:26,322 --> 00:34:27,723

And that cokethat you stole from me.

1142
00:34:48,176 --> 00:34:51,111
Pretending to be dead.

1143
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:53,580
Who do you thinktook the fall for that?

1144
00:34:53,648 --> 00:34:55,548
Huh?

1145
00:34:55,615 --> 00:34:58,017
Pouchy took my finger.

1146
00:34:58,085 --> 00:35:00,619
If I don't come up

1147
00:35:00,687 --> 00:35:03,689
with 15k....he's gonna lobster me.

1148
00:35:03,757 --> 00:35:06,892
A finger every week until allI have left is a lobster claw.

1149
00:35:06,961 --> 00:35:10,228
- Sit down. Sit down.- Do you want the money, or not?

1150
00:35:18,304 --> 00:35:22,365
Vic. That's 20k...15 for your debt,

1151
00:35:22,485 --> 00:35:24,398
and then five for yourpain and suffering.

1152
00:35:24,518 --> 00:35:26,398
That must havebeen some play.

1153
00:35:28,413 --> 00:35:30,081
Mmmmm.

1154
00:35:30,148 --> 00:35:32,850
This is "piss off" money, ok?You don't get to know anything.

1155
00:35:32,917 --> 00:35:36,487
I'm entitledto know everything.

1156
00:35:38,623 --> 00:35:42,225
Can I ask you a question?How do you do it?

1157
00:35:42,293 --> 00:35:45,061
Lying there in that morgue.

1158
00:35:45,129 --> 00:35:47,297
Holding your breath, Sarah,

1159
00:35:47,365 --> 00:35:49,299
while I am bawling,

1160
00:35:49,367 --> 00:35:51,968
I'm cryinglike a goddamn child.

1161
00:35:54,671 --> 00:35:56,606
You know what's crazy?

1162
00:35:56,673 --> 00:35:59,108
You know how stupid I am?

1163
00:35:59,175 --> 00:36:01,576
I'm standing herelooking at you,

1164
00:36:01,644 --> 00:36:04,046
and I keep thinking aboutis Myrtle Beach.

1165
00:36:04,114 --> 00:36:06,315
- You remember?- Yeah, that was

1166
00:36:06,383 --> 00:36:08,783
- a long time ago, Vic.- I was working with that mook,

1167
00:36:08,851 --> 00:36:12,521
- Angel. You had your in with the carnies.- I'm not proud of what we did.

1168
00:36:12,588 --> 00:36:14,958
- We were on top of the world, Sarah.- We were parasites.

1169
00:36:15,078 --> 00:36:18,559
- No, we were in love.- Not me.

1170
00:36:18,627 --> 00:36:20,561
Ever.

1171
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:26,634
I think she means it, Victor.

1172
00:36:26,701 --> 00:36:29,404
You want that money?

1173
00:36:29,471 --> 00:36:31,638
Take it and go now.

1174
00:36:33,641 --> 00:36:35,842
Right now, Vic!

1175
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,877
Ok.

1176
00:36:41,149 --> 00:36:42,882
This is not over, Sarah.

1177
00:36:48,488 --> 00:36:52,024
Is every man in your lifea complete wanker except me?

1178
00:36:52,092 --> 00:36:54,726
I need you togo to S's house.

1179
00:36:54,794 --> 00:36:57,296
Make sure Kira's ok, yeah?

1180
00:36:57,364 --> 00:36:58,871
You're not goingback to Paul's.

1181
00:36:58,991 --> 00:37:00,741
I will not let himthreaten my daughter.

1182
00:37:00,861 --> 00:37:04,235
Sarah, you're not goingback to Paul's! Sarah!

1183
00:37:30,828 --> 00:37:33,063
No, it's fine. Don't worry.

1184
00:37:33,131 --> 00:37:35,664
If anything else comes up,I'll let you know.

1185
00:37:58,988 --> 00:38:02,557
- Felix called you?- Yeah.

1186
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:04,826
He just played me the recording.I heard everything.

1187
00:38:04,893 --> 00:38:07,261
- Where are you?- I'm about to go in

1188
00:38:07,329 --> 00:38:09,830
- and shoot Paul in the balls.- Wait, Sarah.

1189
00:38:09,897 --> 00:38:12,166
This is our chanceto get answers.

1190
00:38:12,234 --> 00:38:14,001
He followed me to Kira, Cos.

1191
00:38:14,068 --> 00:38:16,903
I know, I know,but he also covered for you.

1192
00:38:16,971 --> 00:38:19,440
Right? That Olivier guy,he asked if anything was wrong,

1193
00:38:19,508 --> 00:38:21,208
and Paul said no. Why?

1194
00:38:21,276 --> 00:38:25,811
'Cause I think he may befalling for fake Beth.

1195
00:38:25,879 --> 00:38:27,413
Yes! That's awesome! That...

1196
00:38:27,481 --> 00:38:29,415
- You can use that.- What do you think

1197
00:38:29,483 --> 00:38:31,451
Got me into this messin the first place, huh?

1198
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:33,520
Ok, I know. Just chill.

1199
00:38:33,587 --> 00:38:38,424
I think that Oliver guy,he runs Paul. It sounds like

1200
00:38:38,492 --> 00:38:41,326
- some kind of double blind.- What are you going on about?

1201
00:38:41,394 --> 00:38:43,395
They are keeping Paulin the dark too.

1202
00:38:43,463 --> 00:38:45,831
Right? So that he can'tskew the results either.

1203
00:38:47,701 --> 00:38:50,069
You mean he may not even knowhe's watching a clone?

1204
00:38:50,137 --> 00:38:51,570
Yes, right.

1205
00:38:51,638 --> 00:38:53,639
But Olivier definitely knows.

1206
00:38:53,707 --> 00:38:56,141
Ok? He's the onethat we need to get to.

1207
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,624
You mind if I getthrough Paul first?

1208
00:38:57,744 --> 00:38:58,616
Sarah?

1209
00:39:13,792 --> 00:39:15,225
I'll sleep on the couch.

1210
00:39:15,293 --> 00:39:16,927
Donnie. Donnie, Donnie...

1211
00:39:18,496 --> 00:39:20,630
You're right.

1212
00:39:20,699 --> 00:39:23,200
Everyone deserves their privacy.

1213
00:39:24,402 --> 00:39:26,903
Come.

1214
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:50,959
- I thought you handed in your sidearm.- Huh?

1215
00:39:51,027 --> 00:39:52,694
Left jacket pocket,

1216
00:39:52,762 --> 00:39:54,229
hanging low.

1217
00:39:54,296 --> 00:39:57,599
Well, apparentlyI've got a stalker.

1218
00:40:00,568 --> 00:40:02,103
Sit.

1219
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,441
Put it on the table.

1220
00:40:13,648 --> 00:40:15,481
I knew.

1221
00:40:15,549 --> 00:40:19,252
I couldn't put my fingeron it, but I knew.

1222
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:21,520
It was that day you weresupposed to do the hearing,

1223
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:24,457
- first time we had sex in months.- What? I missed you.

1224
00:40:24,524 --> 00:40:26,726
You were wearingthat clash t-shirt.

1225
00:40:26,794 --> 00:40:29,328
I was like, what?

1226
00:40:29,396 --> 00:40:32,765
And then, wham, you screw meright on the kitchen counter.

1227
00:40:32,832 --> 00:40:35,768
Are you complaining, Paul?What are you saying?

1228
00:40:35,835 --> 00:40:37,535
You quite the force

1229
00:40:37,603 --> 00:40:39,972
after refusingever even to think it.

1230
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:41,586
You know what I'vebeen through.

1231
00:40:41,706 --> 00:40:44,877
And then the scar on your neckjust disappears because of what?

1232
00:40:44,944 --> 00:40:46,611
Some cream?

1233
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:48,512
And now...

1234
00:40:52,584 --> 00:40:54,385
This little girl.

1235
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:57,755
I was there whenBeth found out

1236
00:40:57,823 --> 00:41:00,892
she couldn't have kids.

1237
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:02,893
So who was this girl?

1238
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:07,297
- She's my half-sister.- I watched you together.

1239
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:09,565
She's your daughter,isn't she?

1240
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:13,770
- You're losing it.- Am I?

1241
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:15,772
Well, I was lookingat some old video today.

1242
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,641
You were trainingfor that half marathon.

1243
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:21,043
What was the last raceyou were in?

1244
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:25,281
What city was it in?

1245
00:41:31,888 --> 00:41:33,889
Where is Beth?

1246
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:42,076
One last time.

1247
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:45,278
Whoever you are...

1248
00:41:45,346 --> 00:41:47,280
where is Beth?

1249
00:41:47,348 --> 00:41:49,617
She killed herself.

1250
00:41:49,684 --> 00:41:51,986
She jumpedin front of a train.

1251
00:41:52,053 --> 00:41:54,121
You're English.

1252
00:41:54,188 --> 00:41:56,189
Who are you?

1253
00:41:56,257 --> 00:41:58,191
I'm her twin.

1254
00:41:58,259 --> 00:42:01,127
Twin?

1255
00:42:01,194 --> 00:42:03,129
Is this a test?

1256
00:42:03,196 --> 00:42:04,898
A test of what?

1257
00:42:04,965 --> 00:42:06,933
Beth didn't have a sister.

1258
00:42:07,001 --> 00:42:08,968
What's your name?

1259
00:42:09,036 --> 00:42:10,469
Sarah.

1260
00:42:10,538 --> 00:42:12,639
Sarah what?

1261
00:42:12,706 --> 00:42:15,607
Sarah's good enough.

1262
00:42:15,675 --> 00:42:18,343
When Beth died,I took her identity.

1263
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:20,412
Beth isn't dead.

1264
00:42:22,481 --> 00:42:25,784
Look, I was just gonnaclean out her bank accounts.

1265
00:42:25,852 --> 00:42:28,787
I didn't mean to getall tangled up with you.

1266
00:42:28,855 --> 00:42:31,556
If she really is dead, how doI know you didn't kill her?

1267
00:42:31,623 --> 00:42:34,458
- 'Cause you killed her.- What?

1268
00:42:34,526 --> 00:42:36,727
You're her monitor,aren't you?

1269
00:42:36,795 --> 00:42:38,729
And what's that?

1270
00:42:38,797 --> 00:42:40,531
You observe her.

1271
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:43,267
You let people into her home.

1272
00:42:43,334 --> 00:42:45,036
Like last night.

1273
00:42:47,104 --> 00:42:50,607
Doctors came and medicallyexamined her in her sleep.

1274
00:42:50,675 --> 00:42:52,676
And she knew.

1275
00:42:59,083 --> 00:43:02,485
You're a plant,and she killed herself

1276
00:43:02,553 --> 00:43:06,589
because the man that she lovedturned her whole life into a lie.

1277
00:43:06,656 --> 00:43:09,091
She knew you didn't love her,and she couldn't understand

1278
00:43:09,158 --> 00:43:12,561
why you wouldn't leave.And now she figured it out.

1279
00:43:12,629 --> 00:43:14,463
This isn't true.

1280
00:43:16,365 --> 00:43:19,266
This is a test.

1281
00:43:19,334 --> 00:43:21,736
Isn't it?

1282
00:43:21,804 --> 00:43:24,205
Isn't it?

1283
00:43:24,272 --> 00:43:26,741
She trusted you.

1284
00:43:26,809 --> 00:43:29,644
How could you do that to her?

1285
00:43:35,984 --> 00:43:38,251
You think I had a choice?

1286
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:41,688
Just tell me why.

1287
00:43:41,756 --> 00:43:45,726
They don't tell us why.
