1
00:00:00,083 --> 00:00:02,574
I saw a girl kill herself.

2
00:00:02,576 --> 00:00:04,364
And she looked exactly like me.

3
00:00:04,366 --> 00:00:05,404
Elizabeth Childs.

4
00:00:05,406 --> 00:00:06,836
I'm going to go up to her flat.

5
00:00:06,838 --> 00:00:08,516
To find out who she is or torob the rest of her shit?

6
00:00:08,518 --> 00:00:09,523
Hello?

7
00:00:09,525 --> 00:00:10,688
Holy shite.

8
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,429
Beth is a cop. I'm a cop.

9
00:00:12,431 --> 00:00:13,868
Is this evil twin's money?

10
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:16,942
Yeah, that's enough to getsomewhere safe with my daughter.

11
00:00:17,044 --> 00:00:18,743
I'm going to hang on to thatmoney until you're cleared.

12
00:00:18,745 --> 00:00:20,246
Who the hell is Maggie chen?

13
00:00:20,248 --> 00:00:21,716
That's the woman Beth shot.

14
00:00:21,718 --> 00:00:23,955
- Beth. What's happened?- A lot.

15
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:25,993
Something's different.You are not Beth.

16
00:00:25,995 --> 00:00:27,296
The German's dead.

17
00:00:27,298 --> 00:00:28,933
Someone shot herright in front of me!

18
00:00:28,935 --> 00:00:30,903
Holy shit, it's true! What?

19
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:32,738
That someone is killing us.

20
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,509
Beth, you need toget rid of the body.

21
00:00:34,511 --> 00:00:36,247
Did you get theGerman's briefcase?

22
00:00:36,249 --> 00:00:39,118
No. Why?

23
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,288
Get the briefcasebefore they do.

24
00:00:42,826 --> 00:00:45,293
- Screw it.- Hello?

25
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:46,662
Who is this?

26
00:00:46,664 --> 00:00:48,198
Beth's indisposed.Is this Alison?

27
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,601
How dare you show your facein front of my children.

28
00:00:50,603 --> 00:00:52,038
This is my neighborhood.

29
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,306
You wait for a call.

30
00:00:53,308 --> 00:00:55,843
Hey.

31
00:00:55,845 --> 00:00:57,013
I'm Cosima.

32
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,815
How many of us are there?

33
00:01:07,163 --> 00:01:09,165
Okay, define "orphan", Sarah.

34
00:01:09,167 --> 00:01:10,901
Orphan, orphanage.

35
00:01:10,903 --> 00:01:12,737
So, you don't knowyour birth parents?

36
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,772
No, I was fostered out,

37
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:16,841
then legally adoptedand I came here.

38
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:18,845
When?

39
00:01:18,847 --> 00:01:20,882
Adopted? Like 8.Came here around 12.

40
00:01:20,884 --> 00:01:22,717
Heartbreaking. Can we getback to Beth, please?

41
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:24,152
Suicide?

42
00:01:24,154 --> 00:01:25,854
I don't accept that.

43
00:01:25,856 --> 00:01:27,356
This one's some kind oflowlife grifter!

44
00:01:27,358 --> 00:01:29,359
How do we knowshe didn't push her?

45
00:01:29,361 --> 00:01:31,930
Oi! I already told you...I didn't want to be her.

46
00:01:31,932 --> 00:01:33,432
I got stuck! I was runningfrom my own shit.

47
00:01:33,434 --> 00:01:35,001
I can only imagine.

48
00:01:35,003 --> 00:01:38,172
Alison, I'm very sorryabout Beth, okay?

49
00:01:38,174 --> 00:01:41,243
But she was losing it,

50
00:01:41,245 --> 00:01:42,511
like, clinically.

51
00:01:42,513 --> 00:01:45,047
She was a cop. She had tools.

52
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:47,784
If she couldn't cope,then, I mean...!

53
00:01:47,786 --> 00:01:49,319
Look, can you just tell me

54
00:01:49,321 --> 00:01:50,487
what the hell this is?

55
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:52,723
Don't tell her anything!

56
00:01:52,725 --> 00:01:55,960
- Short answer?- No.

57
00:01:55,962 --> 00:01:58,062
How are we all related?

58
00:01:58,064 --> 00:01:59,163
We're not!

59
00:01:59,165 --> 00:02:00,599
Well, we are, by nature.

60
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:03,402
She's referring to nurture.

61
00:02:03,404 --> 00:02:05,071
Just give us the briefcasethat you got from the German.

62
00:02:05,073 --> 00:02:07,440
I'm not giving you shit 'tilyou give me some answers.

63
00:02:07,442 --> 00:02:08,742
You don't rate answers.

64
00:02:08,744 --> 00:02:11,112
Alison!

65
00:02:11,114 --> 00:02:13,949
Fine! She wants in?We're clones.

66
00:02:13,951 --> 00:02:16,118
We're someone's experimentand they're killing us off!

67
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,621
Is that helpful?!

68
00:02:18,623 --> 00:02:20,490
Hmm?

69
00:02:20,492 --> 00:02:21,558
Mommy?

70
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,827

71
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:25,395
Who are those ladies?

72
00:02:25,397 --> 00:02:27,398
Da da da da da.Just mommy's friends.

73
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,302
How did you get out of bed?

74
00:02:30,304 --> 00:02:32,337
Sorry.

75
00:02:32,339 --> 00:02:33,472
I wanted to float

76
00:02:33,474 --> 00:02:35,841
that whole clone thinga lot softer.

77
00:02:39,748 --> 00:02:41,516
Come on, Sarah.

78
00:02:41,518 --> 00:02:43,118
Shite!

79
00:02:45,622 --> 00:02:47,823
You're not supposed to beparked here at night.

80
00:02:47,825 --> 00:02:49,659
I'm waiting for someone.

81
00:02:49,661 --> 00:02:51,661

Screw it.

86
00:03:25,033 --> 00:03:27,701
We are geneticallyidentical, or whatever.

87
00:03:27,703 --> 00:03:29,202
It's actually kind of cool.

88
00:03:29,204 --> 00:03:31,572

92
00:03:41,884 --> 00:03:43,184

We need to get my shit.

105
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,294
What the hellwere you doing here?

106
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:25,730
Hey, you need this?

107
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:28,566
You just broke the firstrule of clone club.

108
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:33,405
What, "never tell anyoneabout clone club"?

109
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,440
Hi.

110
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:36,908
Awkward. I'm Cosima.

111
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:42,414
You have my number.

112
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:46,318
You want answers?I want the briefcase.

113
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,521
Seriously, it's life-or-death.

114
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,102
You've got to be kidding me.

115
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:40,871
Clones?

116
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:42,139
Clones?!

117
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:45,008
They're not me. They're not.

118
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,643
They're completelydifferent people.

119
00:05:46,645 --> 00:05:48,612
Soccer-mum Sarah,

120
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:50,747
dreadlock science-geek Sarah?

121
00:05:50,749 --> 00:05:53,016
Arguably more attractivethan the real Sarah.

122
00:05:53,018 --> 00:05:54,718
Yeah, I was there, thank you.

123
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,353
How can it be, though?

124
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:58,889
What difference doesit make, Fe?

125
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:00,391
Last time I checked,human cloning

126
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:01,892
was illegal,let alone impossible.

127
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:04,195
Yeah, leave it out, okay?It doesn't matter!

128
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,863
It does matter!

129
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:09,100
Dead Beth, dead German,those two,

130
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:11,435

132
00:06:14,106 --> 00:06:16,540
saying it's life-or-death.You can't just ignore it.

133
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,176
Yes, I can!

134
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:21,245
I'm just me, okay?

135
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:23,047
The song remains the same.

136
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,182
We get the 75 grand backfrom Beth's partner,

137
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:27,184

138
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:29,019
from all this as possible!

139
00:06:38,495 --> 00:06:39,929
Am I going insane?

140
00:06:59,216 --> 00:07:00,817
Hey, Beth.

141
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:02,318
I thought you were still off.

142
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,987
Uh, yeah, justcan't get enough.

143
00:07:04,989 --> 00:07:06,422
Is Art around?

144
00:07:06,424 --> 00:07:08,357
Beth! What the hell's going on?

145
00:07:08,359 --> 00:07:10,726
Yeah, I got to talk to you

146
00:07:10,728 --> 00:07:12,161

147
00:07:13,998 --> 00:07:15,164
Hey, company?

148
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,599

156
00:07:30,382 --> 00:07:31,815
Sorry, just saying hello.

00:07:31,817 --> 00:07:33,750
No, you're not. Both of you.

158
00:07:40,258 --> 00:07:42,659

00:10:16,481 --> 00:10:17,914
they were burying a body

189
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,350
next to an active quarry.

190
00:10:24,789 --> 00:10:26,490
Got a pretty goodtire print over there.

191
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:27,591
I'd say the bodywasn't in the ground

192
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:29,126
more than two,maybe three, days.

193
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,862
Hey, welcome back.

194
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,899
Now, this would be

195
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:37,535
your industrial sausagemaker.

196
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:39,070
Nice of them to lenda hand, though.

197
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,341
Prints?

198
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:45,477
They'd better hit, because

199
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,612
reconstructing the faceis going to be tough.

200
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:51,081
Hey!

201
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,717
Can we get the guyto open this thing up?

202
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:59,123
Uh, I need to makea call, yeah?

203
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,425
One sec.

204
00:11:04,429 --> 00:11:06,898
I can't talk, or meet.Just answer the question.

205
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,266
Oh, okay, okay.

206
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:10,736
Our fingerprintsare close enough

207
00:11:10,738 --> 00:11:12,071
to flag a match, yeah.

208
00:11:12,073 --> 00:11:13,205
Why?

209
00:11:13,207 --> 00:11:14,673
Beth's partner foundthe German...

210
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:16,742
or at least part of her.

211
00:11:16,744 --> 00:11:17,876
Part of her?

212
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:19,878
Yeah, I messed upwhen I buried her.

213
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,380
They have afingerprint, Cosima.

214
00:11:21,382 --> 00:11:25,484
Oh, wait, are youbeing Beth right now?

215
00:11:25,486 --> 00:11:26,986
Pretending to be a bloodycop, so I need to know

216
00:11:26,988 --> 00:11:28,354
if the bloody fingerprints

217
00:11:28,356 --> 00:11:29,722
will flag a bloody match!

218
00:11:29,724 --> 00:11:32,625
Whoa! Okay, okay,don't freak out!

219
00:11:32,627 --> 00:11:34,226
They'd need to use interpol

220
00:11:34,228 --> 00:11:36,128
to find the German,which is unlikely,

221
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:39,098
but if one of us hada criminal record here...

222
00:11:41,602 --> 00:11:44,704
do you have a criminal record?

223
00:11:44,706 --> 00:11:47,774
Just petty fraud,assault, whatever.

224
00:11:47,776 --> 00:11:49,275
Wasted youth, all right?

225
00:11:49,277 --> 00:11:53,078
If the body matches me,the cops will see

226
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,580
a mugshot of somebody

227
00:11:54,582 --> 00:11:56,148
who looks like Beth,only it's yours truly,

228
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,650
and I'm alreadysupposed to be dead.

229
00:11:57,652 --> 00:12:01,120
Wow. Wow, welcometo the trip, man.

230
00:12:01,122 --> 00:12:02,488
That is not helpful.

231
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,491
Yeah, okay, sorry.Just don't bolt, okay?

232
00:12:04,493 --> 00:12:06,159
Don't bolt.

233
00:12:06,161 --> 00:12:07,828
They can't run printsinstantaneously,

234
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,097
so we do have some time here.

235
00:12:10,099 --> 00:12:11,599
How much time?

236
00:12:11,601 --> 00:12:15,436
Bring me the briefcaseand we'll talk, okay?

237
00:12:19,908 --> 00:12:21,342
Beckwith will have an exacttime of death soon,

238
00:12:21,344 --> 00:12:23,444
but 'til then, I saywe ballpark two,

239
00:12:23,446 --> 00:12:25,679
three days, see who's missing.

240
00:12:25,681 --> 00:12:28,982
And fingerprints,

241
00:12:28,984 --> 00:12:30,350
what, a couple days?

242
00:12:30,352 --> 00:12:32,752
Yeah, you know the lab.Hopefully, overnight.

243
00:12:32,754 --> 00:12:35,856
Look, Art, um,this shit with Paul

244
00:12:35,858 --> 00:12:37,324
is about to go sideways, okay?

245
00:12:37,326 --> 00:12:39,325
I need to get to the bank.

246
00:12:39,327 --> 00:12:40,694
Let me see your weapon.

247
00:12:40,696 --> 00:12:43,096
Huh?

248
00:12:43,098 --> 00:12:46,867
Come on, show it to me.

249
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,508
It's empty.

250
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,610
Yeah, what? We left in a hurry.

251
00:12:55,612 --> 00:12:58,046
You rode with me empty!

252
00:12:58,048 --> 00:13:00,515
Art, it's a 10-45for legs, right, Art,

253
00:13:00,517 --> 00:13:02,150
like, I mean, who am Igoing to shoot?

254
00:13:02,152 --> 00:13:04,352
That's bullshit, Beth,for regs and your partner.

255
00:13:04,354 --> 00:13:05,853
Look, if the shooting has you

256
00:13:05,855 --> 00:13:07,722
trigger-shy, Beth, you got to... no.I'm not, I'm not.

257
00:13:07,724 --> 00:13:09,490
I'm not. Just give mean hour or two

258
00:13:09,492 --> 00:13:11,658
to get up to speed,for Christ's sake.

259
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,026
You can get up to speedon the desk, then.

260
00:13:13,028 --> 00:13:16,030
I'll work this with deangelis.

261
00:13:16,032 --> 00:13:17,798
- Now get outta here.- Hey, Art.

262
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,234
Look, if you ask meabout that money

263
00:13:20,236 --> 00:13:21,836
one more time, Beth,I swear to God,

264
00:13:21,838 --> 00:13:23,771
it's going in the shredder.

265
00:13:45,861 --> 00:13:47,362
Hey.

266
00:13:54,405 --> 00:13:55,972
Don't worry,you get used to it.

267
00:13:55,974 --> 00:13:57,574
To clones?

268
00:13:57,576 --> 00:13:59,175
Yeah, I'm not buying that.

269
00:13:59,177 --> 00:14:00,610
How many of us

270
00:14:00,612 --> 00:14:02,379
do you have to meet, Sarah?

271
00:14:02,381 --> 00:14:05,749
Can I have thebriefcase, please?

272
00:14:05,751 --> 00:14:08,018
I want some answers, first.

273
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,421
Well, the answers arein the briefcase.

274
00:14:10,423 --> 00:14:13,657
Let me guess...

275
00:14:13,659 --> 00:14:15,726
you're the smart one,you're the wild one.

276
00:14:15,728 --> 00:14:17,394
Would you believe we're clones?

277
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,064
Bourbon, rocks.

278
00:14:20,066 --> 00:14:21,866
You got it.

279
00:14:21,868 --> 00:14:24,435
So you're the scientistthe German was on about.

280
00:14:24,437 --> 00:14:27,137
Yes... well, phd student,

281
00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:29,306
evolutionarydevelopmental biology

282
00:14:29,308 --> 00:14:31,175
at university of Minnesota.

283
00:14:31,177 --> 00:14:32,610
I'm heading back there tonight.

284
00:14:32,612 --> 00:14:34,912
The German was sick.

285
00:14:34,914 --> 00:14:36,447
Should I be worried about that?

286
00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:38,215
Well, if you give me the case,

287
00:14:38,217 --> 00:14:39,984
I'll know in a couple weeks.

288
00:14:39,986 --> 00:14:41,819
Do you know whoshot her in the head?

289
00:14:43,656 --> 00:14:48,760
Okay, ahem! So, six months ago,

290
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:50,528
katja contacted Bethwith this crazy story

291
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,863
about her genetic identicals

292
00:14:51,865 --> 00:14:53,231
being hunted in Europe.

293
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:58,370
"Hunted"?

294
00:14:58,372 --> 00:14:59,405
Brilliant.

295
00:14:59,407 --> 00:15:00,673
I know.

296
00:15:00,675 --> 00:15:03,843
So Beth used facial-recognition software

297
00:15:03,845 --> 00:15:06,278
to find driver's licenses

298
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,446
in north America.

299
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,681
Two matches.

300
00:15:08,683 --> 00:15:10,049
You and soccer bitch.

301
00:15:10,051 --> 00:15:11,183
Yeah, right.

302
00:15:11,185 --> 00:15:13,785
But who is the original?

303
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:16,522
Who's created us?

304
00:15:16,524 --> 00:15:19,258
Who's killing us?

305
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,927
We need to know, but,we lost our cop, so,

306
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:23,629
however you manageto get into her shoes,

307
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,131
we really need youto stay there.

308
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:27,634
Stay a cop to help you?

309
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:29,870
To help us.

310
00:15:29,872 --> 00:15:33,340
Help us find outwho's killing us.

311
00:15:33,342 --> 00:15:35,109
How?! I'm not a cop.

312
00:15:35,111 --> 00:15:37,445
Beth's partner'sgoing to figure that out.

313
00:15:37,447 --> 00:15:38,946
Being Beth is whatgot me into this mess,

314
00:15:38,948 --> 00:15:40,381
in the first place.

315
00:15:40,383 --> 00:15:42,783
I know, I know.I get it, I get it.

316
00:15:42,785 --> 00:15:44,986
But you can't runaway from her.

317
00:15:44,988 --> 00:15:48,189
Look, we are yourbiological imperative

318
00:15:48,191 --> 00:15:49,390
now, okay?

319
00:15:49,392 --> 00:15:51,458
Katja's fingerprints

320
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,994
will match your fingerprints.

321
00:15:52,996 --> 00:15:54,996
So get to katja's

322
00:15:54,998 --> 00:15:56,464
fingerprint results, somehow.

323
00:15:56,466 --> 00:15:58,400
I think that's our only option.

324
00:16:01,037 --> 00:16:02,471
All right.

325
00:16:02,473 --> 00:16:06,041
Just answer me one thing...

326
00:16:06,043 --> 00:16:08,477
anything, yes.

327
00:16:08,479 --> 00:16:11,547
If we're genetically identical,

328
00:16:11,549 --> 00:16:14,015
do you get that littlepatch of dry skin

329
00:16:14,017 --> 00:16:15,417
between your eyebrows?

330
00:16:17,255 --> 00:16:20,356
That's good.

331
00:16:20,358 --> 00:16:24,494
Try to keep yoursense of humor.

332
00:16:24,496 --> 00:16:25,595
Beth couldn't.

333
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,148
No cream?

334
00:16:40,947 --> 00:16:42,379
You're booked on the range

335
00:16:42,381 --> 00:16:45,015
day after tomorrow, 4:00.

336
00:16:45,017 --> 00:16:46,082
"The range"?

337
00:16:46,084 --> 00:16:48,584
The gun range?Are you with me or not?

338
00:16:48,586 --> 00:16:51,353
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

339
00:16:51,355 --> 00:16:53,389
So what about Jane Doe?

340
00:16:53,391 --> 00:16:54,857
Beckwith filled a bucket

341
00:16:54,859 --> 00:16:56,592
with fragments from the hopper.

342
00:16:56,594 --> 00:16:58,027
Couple solids so far...

343
00:16:58,029 --> 00:17:02,665
- dyed red hair.- Like bright red.

344
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:03,684
And laying outthe skull fragments,

345
00:17:03,809 --> 00:17:06,544
she's 99% sure she foundentry and exit wounds.

346
00:17:06,872 --> 00:17:09,739
A shooting. So whatabout the prints?

347
00:17:09,741 --> 00:17:11,774
Start calling.

348
00:17:11,776 --> 00:17:13,276
And keep callingwhile you clear

349
00:17:13,278 --> 00:17:15,912
that shitpile of a desk.

350
00:17:15,914 --> 00:17:17,080
Hey,

351
00:17:17,082 --> 00:17:18,648
sorry about poachingyour seat on this, eh?

352
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,017
He's all yours.

353
00:17:20,019 --> 00:17:22,219
Let's go. Yeah.

354
00:17:24,924 --> 00:17:27,724
Detective Bell.

355
00:17:27,726 --> 00:17:29,526
Yeah, well, what can youtell me about her?

356
00:17:29,528 --> 00:17:31,128
Jane Doe.

357
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,130
Hey, hey!

358
00:17:33,132 --> 00:17:35,400
Shh! Shh!

359
00:17:35,402 --> 00:17:38,003
You want to give me that again?

360
00:17:38,005 --> 00:17:40,739
Am I speaking

361
00:17:40,741 --> 00:17:42,307
to your partner now, too, Art?

362
00:17:42,309 --> 00:17:44,242
Actually, we lovevoicechange apps,

363
00:17:44,244 --> 00:17:47,746
so the whole officeis listening.

364
00:17:47,748 --> 00:17:50,916
She was just one of a few,

365
00:17:50,918 --> 00:17:54,853
unfit for family, horse glue.

366
00:17:54,855 --> 00:17:56,488
So you didn'tlike her very much.

367
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:58,557
How about you tell us her name.

368
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,961
She expired at allenside park.

369
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,066
So, what,

370
00:18:08,068 --> 00:18:10,602
Stephen Hawking did it?

371
00:18:10,604 --> 00:18:12,437
The call came to me.

372
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:16,241
"Just one of a few,unfit for family..."

373
00:18:16,243 --> 00:18:17,842
"Horse glue"? Shit!

374
00:18:17,844 --> 00:18:20,078
What... what else did they say?

375
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,580
They asked if I was thelead on the quarry body.

376
00:18:22,582 --> 00:18:24,750
Listen, before we go,

377
00:18:24,752 --> 00:18:26,318
we'll check the desk,to see who took the call.

378
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,319
Yeah.

379
00:18:27,321 --> 00:18:28,820
Are you going to allenside?

380
00:18:28,822 --> 00:18:30,789
Yeah. Check the log,to see if there were

381
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,290
any shots fired down there.

382
00:18:32,292 --> 00:18:34,192
Hey, look, I'll see youin a bit, okay?

383
00:18:59,384 --> 00:19:01,819
Hey!

384
00:19:01,821 --> 00:19:03,387
Raj.

385
00:19:03,389 --> 00:19:06,858
Detective.

386
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,892
Beth.

387
00:19:07,894 --> 00:19:10,395
Hi.

388
00:19:10,397 --> 00:19:12,631
So you probably knowI've been off

389
00:19:12,633 --> 00:19:13,999
for a while.

390
00:19:14,001 --> 00:19:15,233
Yeah.

391
00:19:15,235 --> 00:19:17,302
Yeah, nightmare.

392
00:19:17,304 --> 00:19:20,939
PTSD, fatal civilian shooting,

393
00:19:20,941 --> 00:19:26,079
inquiry, medication,the whole enchilada.

394
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:27,513
Gum?

395
00:19:27,515 --> 00:19:28,848
Uh, thanks.

396
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:31,985
So I guess

397
00:19:31,987 --> 00:19:33,820
you're back, then, right?

398
00:19:33,822 --> 00:19:35,322
Mm, I'm benched.

399
00:19:35,324 --> 00:19:36,990
I'm trying to slip inwithout, you know,

400
00:19:36,992 --> 00:19:39,225
a ripple, but,

401
00:19:39,227 --> 00:19:42,162
on the down-low, I'ma little scattered,

402
00:19:42,164 --> 00:19:43,763
memorywise.

403
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:46,032
You think you couldhelp with a few basics?

404
00:19:46,034 --> 00:19:47,733
Oh, like resettingyour password?

405
00:19:47,735 --> 00:19:50,637
Yes, like that.

406
00:19:50,639 --> 00:19:54,407
And the whole procedurefor fingerprint results.

407
00:19:54,409 --> 00:19:57,277
I said an hour, Childs.I haven't checked yet.

408
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,778
They're in, though?Because I got

409
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,348
a Jane Doe with zero leads.

410
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:02,351
They're probably inmy inbox. Just hang on.

411
00:20:02,903 --> 00:20:04,335
Yep, not a problem.

412
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:07,805
Childs!

413
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,275
"Results from central".I'm helping you out.

414
00:20:12,241 --> 00:20:13,914
I got to log those!

415
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:17,873
It's all good! Nothing, anyway.

416
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,619
Don't do that again, Childs.

417
00:20:19,621 --> 00:20:23,389
I don't know, Art, you thinksomeone's jerking your chain?

418
00:20:32,037 --> 00:20:32,815
Auto glass.

419
00:20:32,817 --> 00:20:33,882
Hmm.

420
00:20:33,884 --> 00:20:35,784
Looks like a fastexit that way.

421
00:20:35,786 --> 00:20:39,521
I don't see any casings.

422
00:20:40,645 --> 00:20:43,669
Could be line-of-fire,at range.

423
00:20:43,794 --> 00:20:44,369
Hmm.

424
00:20:54,471 --> 00:20:56,272
I've seen your elaborate ruses

425
00:20:56,274 --> 00:20:57,773
and guises before,

426
00:20:57,775 --> 00:20:59,508
but how do you do this,

427
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:02,177
how do you fake your owndemise beneath a train?

428
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:03,979
Wouldn't you rather know why?

429
00:21:03,981 --> 00:21:06,148
I don't care to know why.

430
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:08,317
Because I saw a way to dump Vic

431
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:10,486
and get out of that life

432
00:21:10,488 --> 00:21:12,455
and get away with Kira.

433
00:21:12,457 --> 00:21:14,991
Ha! Take heron the run with you?

434
00:21:14,993 --> 00:21:17,526
Brilliant.

435
00:21:17,528 --> 00:21:19,796
New clothes and a Jaguardo not a mother make.

436
00:21:19,798 --> 00:21:21,964
Lee of the point.

437
00:21:26,436 --> 00:21:28,738
Ugh! I don't remember.

438
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,173
Buffleheads.

439
00:21:30,175 --> 00:21:33,977
Barrow's goldeneye.Just passing through.

440
00:21:39,384 --> 00:21:41,485
I'll set up a visit,

441
00:21:41,487 --> 00:21:43,555
but the only way

442
00:21:43,557 --> 00:21:45,156
you will regaincustody of Kira is

443
00:21:45,158 --> 00:21:48,660
to show me thatyou can be still.

444
00:21:51,997 --> 00:21:54,832
You're not her legal guardian.

445
00:21:54,834 --> 00:21:56,167
Mine either, anymore.

446
00:21:56,169 --> 00:21:58,202
You can visit.Any other approach,

447
00:21:58,204 --> 00:21:59,737
and I will stop lying tosocial services for you.

448
00:21:59,739 --> 00:22:01,039
You wouldn't do that to Kira.

449
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:02,040
No.

450
00:22:02,042 --> 00:22:05,410
I'd do it to you.

451
00:22:19,659 --> 00:22:21,426
Hey, someone cleared this out,

452
00:22:21,428 --> 00:22:22,961
laid down in here.

453
00:22:22,963 --> 00:22:25,397
Around here? Probably homeless.

454
00:22:25,399 --> 00:22:28,700
Yeah, but someone movedthis into position.

455
00:22:28,702 --> 00:22:30,202
Hey, this look likea blind to you,

456
00:22:30,204 --> 00:22:32,104
a log for someone

457
00:22:32,106 --> 00:22:34,339
to lay a rifle on?

458
00:22:34,341 --> 00:22:36,608
Weeds knocked downfor sight lines.

459
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:38,243
Where are you?

460
00:22:38,245 --> 00:22:39,778
Uh, back at school.

461
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,547
What, school?

462
00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:43,182
What? Oh, shit! Right.

463
00:22:43,184 --> 00:22:46,019
Right, right, right.Minneapolis, shit!

464
00:22:46,021 --> 00:22:47,588
What's going on?

465
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,089
Well, I managed to scrapthe fingerprint

466
00:22:49,091 --> 00:22:50,590
results...for a while, anyway...

467
00:22:50,592 --> 00:22:54,294
but the killercontacted Art, Cosima.

468
00:22:54,296 --> 00:22:55,730
He's already at the scene

469
00:22:55,732 --> 00:22:57,198
where katja was shot.

470
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,233
Okay, that's good.Just stick with him.

471
00:22:59,235 --> 00:23:00,434
I can't!

472
00:23:00,436 --> 00:23:02,436
He's benched me becauseI'm bloody useless!

473
00:23:02,438 --> 00:23:04,504
I need help, Cosima.

474
00:23:04,506 --> 00:23:05,872
He wants meon the range tomorrow.

475
00:23:05,874 --> 00:23:07,707
I've never even fired a gun.

476
00:23:07,709 --> 00:23:09,709
All right, well,just hold tight.

477
00:23:09,711 --> 00:23:11,377
We know somebodywho can help with that.

478
00:23:11,379 --> 00:23:12,879
Are you serious?

479
00:23:12,881 --> 00:23:14,748
If you are.

480
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,249
You know we gota motorcycle tread

481
00:23:16,251 --> 00:23:17,917
- over here, Art.- Yeah?

482
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,452
Yeah. Yeah, it's a good print.

483
00:23:19,454 --> 00:23:21,221
Could be the shooter's getaway.

484
00:23:21,223 --> 00:23:22,622
Yeah, but a long gunon a motorcycle?

485
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:25,725
Could be the weaponbroke down, right?

486
00:23:25,727 --> 00:23:27,160
Yeah, it could be.

487
00:23:30,364 --> 00:23:33,032
Hey, I got something over here.

488
00:23:42,244 --> 00:23:43,777
Head shot.

489
00:23:47,949 --> 00:23:49,983
Bright red hair.

490
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,926
It has to be this morning.

491
00:23:57,928 --> 00:24:00,862
Art's got me chasingdown motorcycle models

492
00:24:00,864 --> 00:24:03,832
from tire tracks and I'mshooting bloody targets

493
00:24:03,834 --> 00:24:05,634
at a gun range tomorrow.

494
00:24:05,636 --> 00:24:08,237
Well, I can't just conjurea sitter out of thin air.

495
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:09,805
It's weekend primetime, Sarah.

496
00:24:09,807 --> 00:24:11,173
Well, then,

497
00:24:11,175 --> 00:24:13,476
we're all screwed. Aren't we?

498
00:24:13,478 --> 00:24:16,780
Donnie! Ahem.

499
00:24:16,782 --> 00:24:18,214
Can you watch the kids

500
00:24:18,216 --> 00:24:19,849
for a couple of hours today?

501
00:24:19,851 --> 00:24:21,150
Golf. Give it!

502
00:24:21,152 --> 00:24:22,452
On television?

503
00:24:22,454 --> 00:24:24,520
No, I have a tee time,remember?

504
00:24:27,357 --> 00:24:29,858
I'm sorry, I'm coming up empty.

505
00:24:33,897 --> 00:24:35,297
I may have a solution.

506
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,772
Gemma, Oscar, this is Felix.

507
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:45,708
Hello!

508
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:50,947
Brilliant.

509
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:52,082
So I'm going outfor a couple of hours,

510
00:24:52,084 --> 00:24:54,751
so you be good

511
00:24:54,753 --> 00:24:58,321
or mommy's going to bevery upset, okay?

512
00:24:58,323 --> 00:24:59,689
Same goes for you.

513
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,493
So,

514
00:25:03,495 --> 00:25:05,528
what now?

515
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:10,466
Does your daddy havea drinks trolley?

516
00:25:10,468 --> 00:25:11,634
What's that?

517
00:25:11,636 --> 00:25:14,738
Don't worry. I'll find it.

518
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,107
You.

519
00:25:17,109 --> 00:25:18,875
You want to dress uplike a little girl?

520
00:25:18,877 --> 00:25:19,976
No!

521
00:25:19,978 --> 00:25:21,545
Well, I don't haveanything for you, then.

522
00:25:21,547 --> 00:25:23,346
I'll dress up like a boy.

523
00:25:23,348 --> 00:25:25,482
We can work with that.

524
00:25:25,484 --> 00:25:27,284
No, the make and model

525
00:25:27,286 --> 00:25:28,819
match the treadthat deangelis sent you.

526
00:25:28,821 --> 00:25:30,988
Sports bike, suzuki sv650.

527
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:35,058
Black tank, custom pipes,

528
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,160
and stolen when?

529
00:25:36,162 --> 00:25:37,828
Reported four days ago.

530
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:40,564
I should probably get backto my real job now.

531
00:25:40,566 --> 00:25:41,932
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.Just, um,

532
00:25:41,934 --> 00:25:44,568
put out a... You know.

533
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:46,604
An apb.

534
00:25:46,606 --> 00:25:48,539
Yes. Yes, asap.

535
00:25:48,541 --> 00:25:49,940
Sorry, I'm at the the doctor.

536
00:25:49,942 --> 00:25:51,375
My phone's about to die.

537
00:25:51,377 --> 00:25:53,344
Okay, I'll getsomeone to do it.

538
00:25:53,346 --> 00:25:55,479
Thanks, raj.

539
00:25:57,915 --> 00:26:00,450
Well, go.

540
00:26:09,793 --> 00:26:11,894
Okay, reload,

541
00:26:11,896 --> 00:26:13,529
try again.

542
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:16,566
So, most city copscarry Glocks,

543
00:26:16,568 --> 00:26:18,301
but a walther p99,

544
00:26:18,303 --> 00:26:20,569
it has an optional-sized hand grip.

545
00:26:20,571 --> 00:26:22,405
It's good for women, Beth said,

546
00:26:22,407 --> 00:26:24,908
particularly women

547
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:27,076
living their liveslike rats in a lab.

548
00:26:27,078 --> 00:26:29,479
Is that what you think?

549
00:26:29,481 --> 00:26:31,014
Well, what else could it be?

550
00:26:31,016 --> 00:26:34,951
Someone is covering uptheir illegal experiments

551
00:26:34,953 --> 00:26:36,320
by wiping us out.

552
00:26:36,322 --> 00:26:38,756
Well, whatever it is,

553
00:26:38,758 --> 00:26:40,891
I need to protect my family,

554
00:26:40,893 --> 00:26:43,527
so Beth taught me how to shoot.

555
00:26:43,529 --> 00:26:46,330
For that, I am grateful to her.

556
00:26:46,332 --> 00:26:49,767
I'm sorry you lost her,

557
00:26:49,769 --> 00:26:51,903
but anything

558
00:26:51,905 --> 00:26:53,504
you can tell meabout her will help.

559
00:26:53,506 --> 00:26:55,039
I fail to see

560
00:26:55,041 --> 00:26:57,775
how someone like youcan fill Beth's shoes.

561
00:26:57,777 --> 00:27:00,445
Truth is, I barely knew Beth.

562
00:27:00,447 --> 00:27:03,414
She was all business,but I admired her.

563
00:27:03,416 --> 00:27:04,782
She didn't pry.

564
00:27:04,784 --> 00:27:06,150
She was discreet.She didn't bring

565
00:27:06,152 --> 00:27:07,551
her foster brother to my house.

566
00:27:07,553 --> 00:27:09,420
I didn't know the rulesof clone club, did I?

567
00:27:09,422 --> 00:27:11,255
Can you not use the c-word?

568
00:27:11,257 --> 00:27:12,390
Please.

569
00:27:22,368 --> 00:27:25,803
Shit.

570
00:27:25,805 --> 00:27:30,240
Stop here. I'll walk the rest.

571
00:27:31,644 --> 00:27:33,777
So my bottom line

572
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:35,512
is my children can't know

573
00:27:35,514 --> 00:27:37,147
their mother is a freak.

574
00:27:37,149 --> 00:27:38,649
Things have to stayon a need-to-know basis.

575
00:27:38,651 --> 00:27:40,451
Yeah, I'm fine with that.

576
00:27:40,453 --> 00:27:43,154
Good.

577
00:27:43,156 --> 00:27:44,255
So,

578
00:27:44,257 --> 00:27:45,690
we've made a decisionto trust you.

579
00:27:45,692 --> 00:27:47,225
Really?

580
00:27:47,227 --> 00:27:49,394
Sarah, this is my life now

581
00:27:49,396 --> 00:27:51,496
and I'm doing the best I can.

582
00:27:53,132 --> 00:27:57,769
Ahem, so Beth had, um,a substantial sum,

583
00:27:57,771 --> 00:27:59,437
sort of a fund she used to buy

584
00:27:59,439 --> 00:28:01,038
information we couldn'tget officially.

585
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,640
Okay.

586
00:28:02,642 --> 00:28:04,175
We were a cop,

587
00:28:04,177 --> 00:28:08,379
a scientist, and myself.

588
00:28:08,381 --> 00:28:09,847
The fund was howI could contribute.

589
00:28:09,849 --> 00:28:11,149
How much?

590
00:28:11,151 --> 00:28:13,151
$75,000.

591
00:28:13,153 --> 00:28:16,387
You could rob me blind.

592
00:28:16,389 --> 00:28:17,989
But we're hoping you realize

593
00:28:17,991 --> 00:28:19,423
you can't run from this.

594
00:28:21,494 --> 00:28:26,031
So, can you conher bank, or not?

595
00:28:30,537 --> 00:28:32,237
Good.

596
00:28:44,584 --> 00:28:46,651
Oh, Gemma!

597
00:28:46,653 --> 00:28:49,120
Look, mom, we're crossdressers!

598
00:28:49,122 --> 00:28:50,555
No, you are not.

599
00:28:50,557 --> 00:28:51,689
I'm you!

600
00:28:51,691 --> 00:28:54,192
Oh! You're back.

601
00:28:54,194 --> 00:28:56,861
Felix! Don't go!

602
00:28:56,863 --> 00:28:58,730
Can Felix stay the night, mom?

603
00:28:58,732 --> 00:28:59,864
No!

604
00:28:59,866 --> 00:29:01,900
My work here is done,I'm afraid.

605
00:29:01,902 --> 00:29:02,867
No!

606
00:29:02,869 --> 00:29:04,436
Stay, Felix.

607
00:29:04,438 --> 00:29:05,504
Adios, dragsters.

608
00:29:07,707 --> 00:29:10,543
Wow, okay, so,

609
00:29:10,545 --> 00:29:12,144
the money belongs to Alison.

610
00:29:12,146 --> 00:29:13,445
Mm-hmm.

611
00:29:13,447 --> 00:29:15,214
So what are yougoing to do now?

612
00:29:15,216 --> 00:29:16,749
Are you going torip off your new sis

613
00:29:16,751 --> 00:29:18,083
and abscond with Kira?

614
00:29:18,085 --> 00:29:20,152
She's not my sister and,

615
00:29:20,154 --> 00:29:21,687
yeah, that's exactlywhat we do.

616
00:29:21,689 --> 00:29:22,821
Well.

617
00:29:22,823 --> 00:29:24,590
Shit!

618
00:29:24,592 --> 00:29:25,791
Hide!

619
00:29:25,793 --> 00:29:27,326
You cannot hide inminimalist furniture!

620
00:29:27,328 --> 00:29:28,327
Go!

621
00:29:28,329 --> 00:29:31,063
Shit!

622
00:29:31,065 --> 00:29:32,798
What?

623
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,132
You're not supposed to be here.

624
00:29:34,134 --> 00:29:35,300
Nice.

625
00:29:35,302 --> 00:29:36,801
I thought...

626
00:29:36,803 --> 00:29:38,303
you're stayingat Cody's for a while.

627
00:29:38,305 --> 00:29:39,837
I think that's a good idea!

628
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:41,338
Well, I think you'rebeing a bitch.

629
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,840
I'm the bigger person, here.

630
00:29:42,842 --> 00:29:44,808
I need a change of clothes.

631
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:47,811
Uh, I've been reinstated, Paul.

632
00:29:47,813 --> 00:29:50,447
Hey.

633
00:29:50,449 --> 00:29:51,548
Oh.

634
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,317
Well, how do youfeel about that?

635
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:56,020
What, are youpainting by numbers?

636
00:29:56,022 --> 00:29:57,155
I guess I am.

637
00:29:57,157 --> 00:30:01,526
Okay, I'm sorryI'm like this, Paul.

638
00:30:01,528 --> 00:30:03,329
You're not like this,

639
00:30:03,331 --> 00:30:05,497
Beth, it's your job.

640
00:30:05,499 --> 00:30:07,033
Yeah, but I'ma cop first, Paul,

641
00:30:07,035 --> 00:30:09,435
but, shit.

642
00:30:09,437 --> 00:30:12,038
How would you like itif I started pulling

643
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,539
this schizophrenic hot-and-cold crap on you?

644
00:30:13,541 --> 00:30:16,375
Maybe you should, Paul.

645
00:30:16,377 --> 00:30:18,745
I mean, seriously, whereare we going with this?

646
00:31:08,561 --> 00:31:10,663
Sorry,

647
00:31:10,665 --> 00:31:13,366
got to go.

648
00:31:25,948 --> 00:31:29,884
Oh. My. God.

649
00:31:29,886 --> 00:31:31,385
Oh!

650
00:31:31,387 --> 00:31:32,887
She doesn't want to break up

651
00:31:32,889 --> 00:31:34,922
with big-dick Paul, unh.

652
00:31:34,924 --> 00:31:36,958
He smells it in her musk.

653
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,560
You are stuffed!

654
00:31:38,562 --> 00:31:41,562
Oh, holy shit.

655
00:31:41,564 --> 00:31:43,898
Oh, don't worry, I bethe's wanking already.

656
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,933
Oh, he'd better be.

657
00:31:45,935 --> 00:31:47,368
Oh! Paul, all soapy.

658
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:50,237
No, no, no, no! Ugh, ah!

659
00:31:50,239 --> 00:31:51,672
Eye on the prize, okay?

660
00:31:51,674 --> 00:31:54,741
Get the money back fromBeth's other partner,

661
00:31:54,743 --> 00:31:56,076
get out.

662
00:32:05,787 --> 00:32:07,288
Maybe it's yourlady-grip walther.

663
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:09,590
You like your bigGlock, don't ya?

664
00:32:12,295 --> 00:32:15,396
So, two sets of tire tracks

665
00:32:15,398 --> 00:32:16,831
at the crime scene...

666
00:32:16,833 --> 00:32:18,265
one motorcycle and one car?

667
00:32:18,267 --> 00:32:20,834
Yeah, but there had to bethree people there.

668
00:32:20,836 --> 00:32:23,804
So if the killer's ona motorcycle, then, what,

669
00:32:23,806 --> 00:32:25,639
he has an accomplice,

670
00:32:25,641 --> 00:32:27,141
drives the Vic to the quarry?

671
00:32:27,143 --> 00:32:28,709
Or the Vic has a driver,

672
00:32:28,711 --> 00:32:30,644
who doesn't goto police, panics,

673
00:32:30,646 --> 00:32:33,281
and half-ass buries the body?

674
00:32:33,283 --> 00:32:35,483
Yeah, the body dump

675
00:32:35,485 --> 00:32:37,284
doesn't matchthe professional hit.

676
00:32:37,286 --> 00:32:39,019
Exactly.

677
00:32:39,021 --> 00:32:41,589
And I got somethingelse for you, Beth.

678
00:32:41,591 --> 00:32:43,758
You're going to love this.

679
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,661
That was in the sniper's nest.

680
00:32:46,663 --> 00:32:49,463
Yeah, we got a live one.

681
00:32:49,465 --> 00:32:52,300
Phone calls, leaving clues,

682
00:32:52,302 --> 00:32:53,601
messing with us.

683
00:32:54,671 --> 00:32:57,639
Range 7! Weapons down, please!

684
00:32:57,641 --> 00:33:00,575
Det Childs.

685
00:33:00,577 --> 00:33:03,878
Yeah, suzuki?

686
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,148
Okay, hang on a sec.

687
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:08,516
All clear!

688
00:33:08,518 --> 00:33:09,651
Okay.

689
00:33:09,653 --> 00:33:11,285
Thanks.

690
00:33:11,287 --> 00:33:12,453
Patrol spotted

691
00:33:12,455 --> 00:33:13,989
my stolen suzukidown in parkdale.

692
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:16,658
It's a long shot,

693
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:19,094
but may as well seeif the tires match.

694
00:33:26,481 --> 00:33:28,469
Is this the stolen sport bike?

695
00:33:28,471 --> 00:33:31,138
Yeah, it looks like it.

696
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,740
All right,let's find the super.

697
00:33:37,045 --> 00:33:38,612
My son, my son!

698
00:33:38,614 --> 00:33:39,947
Yeah, I know, he's not home,

699
00:33:39,949 --> 00:33:42,983
but the motorcycle,

700
00:33:42,985 --> 00:33:44,485
does it belong to a renter?

701
00:33:44,487 --> 00:33:46,620
Upstairs! My son no here.

702
00:33:46,622 --> 00:33:48,489
Thank you.

703
00:33:48,491 --> 00:33:50,858
I thought you were the onewho's supposed to deal

704
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,426
with the nonenglish-speaking majority.

705
00:33:52,428 --> 00:33:54,661
Yeah, my Ukrainian sucks.

706
00:34:08,609 --> 00:34:10,276
Easy access.

707
00:34:23,356 --> 00:34:25,190
Motorcycle gloves.

708
00:34:30,263 --> 00:34:31,330
It's open.

709
00:35:05,131 --> 00:35:07,933
What you got there?

710
00:35:07,935 --> 00:35:09,602
Uh...

711
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:13,974
"For you formedmy inward parts;

712
00:35:13,976 --> 00:35:15,742
You knitted metogether in my..."

713
00:35:15,744 --> 00:35:18,044
"Mother's womb. I praise you,

714
00:35:18,046 --> 00:35:21,014
for I am fearfullyand wonderfully made."

715
00:35:21,016 --> 00:35:23,115
Bibles, dolls.

716
00:35:23,117 --> 00:35:25,217
This perp's got some deepseated

717
00:35:25,219 --> 00:35:26,419
spiritual problems.

718
00:35:34,962 --> 00:35:37,929
Art, you're hurt!Art, you're hurt!

719
00:35:37,931 --> 00:35:38,997
Go!

720
00:35:38,999 --> 00:35:40,398
Go? No!

721
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,899
I'm okay! Go!

722
00:35:41,901 --> 00:35:44,335
Go after him! Go!

723
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:53,144
Shit.

724
00:35:55,781 --> 00:35:56,881
Freeze! Police!

725
00:35:58,917 --> 00:36:00,651
Shit. Shit!

726
00:36:00,653 --> 00:36:01,786
Shit.

727
00:36:32,951 --> 00:36:34,686
Shots fired!

728
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:38,123
780 bain. Bain and heward!

729
00:36:38,125 --> 00:36:40,059
Foot pursuit in progress.

730
00:36:54,944 --> 00:36:56,176
Art.

731
00:36:56,178 --> 00:36:58,545
Where are you?

732
00:36:58,547 --> 00:37:00,114
I think he went west

733
00:37:00,116 --> 00:37:02,416
between the two...the rowhouses.

734
00:37:02,418 --> 00:37:04,118
I think he went into one

735
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,454
of the abandonedbuildings here.

736
00:37:07,523 --> 00:37:09,091
Beth!

737
00:37:13,596 --> 00:37:15,196
Beth!

738
00:37:15,198 --> 00:37:16,531
No!

739
00:37:17,834 --> 00:37:19,267
Beth.

740
00:37:28,111 --> 00:37:29,877
Good riddance,

741
00:37:29,879 --> 00:37:32,546
Elizabeth Childs.

742
00:37:32,548 --> 00:37:34,915
I'm not Beth!

743
00:37:50,465 --> 00:37:53,634
Dirty little copy cop.

744
00:37:53,636 --> 00:37:55,903
Who are you?

745
00:38:00,776 --> 00:38:01,743
Ogh!

746
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:19,361
Not yet, not-Beth.

747
00:38:28,605 --> 00:38:29,905
Beth!

748
00:38:34,577 --> 00:38:36,278
Beth!

749
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,480
Jesus Christ!

750
00:38:42,085 --> 00:38:43,519
Are you okay?

751
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:45,521
Hey.

752
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:47,023
I'm fine, I'm fine.

753
00:38:47,025 --> 00:38:48,691
Where'd he go?

754
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:49,692
Hey!

755
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:53,295
Okay, okay, I gotcha.

756
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:55,130
I gotcha, come on.

757
00:39:06,436 --> 00:39:08,019
All I saw was hoodie.

758
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:10,772
He hit me from behind.

759
00:39:10,774 --> 00:39:12,274
Then you struggled withhim at close quarters?

760
00:39:12,276 --> 00:39:14,243
Yeah, I was almost out.I never saw his face.

761
00:39:14,245 --> 00:39:15,411
Lieutenant.

762
00:39:16,413 --> 00:39:18,079
I almost lost not one,but two detectives.

763
00:39:18,081 --> 00:39:20,281
How the hell are you inthis without backup, Art?

764
00:39:20,283 --> 00:39:22,217
It was a thread, lieutenant.

765
00:39:22,219 --> 00:39:23,885
It was a flimsy leadon a stolen bike.

766
00:39:23,887 --> 00:39:26,654
Well, it sure hit.

767
00:39:26,656 --> 00:39:27,889
Are you sure you're all right?

768
00:39:27,891 --> 00:39:29,824
I'm fine.

769
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:32,928
Just let me take her home.

770
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:36,198
I never should've toldyou to go after him.

771
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,133
Of course I'm going togo after him, Art.

772
00:39:38,135 --> 00:39:39,467
It's not your fault.

773
00:39:39,469 --> 00:39:41,870
No, no, I should'vehad your back.

774
00:39:41,872 --> 00:39:44,573
You had mine.I didn't have yours.

775
00:39:44,575 --> 00:39:46,141
Yes, you did.

776
00:39:46,143 --> 00:39:48,110
Look, shit happens fast, okay?

777
00:39:48,112 --> 00:39:49,611
Will you please?

778
00:39:49,613 --> 00:39:51,112
I'm not going tolet you drive me home

779
00:39:51,114 --> 00:39:53,314
like an invalid, okay?

780
00:39:53,316 --> 00:39:56,150
I just need a showerand an early start

781
00:39:56,152 --> 00:39:57,652
so we can catch this guy, okay?

782
00:39:57,654 --> 00:39:59,553
Hey.

783
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:10,731
Your money's all there.

784
00:40:10,733 --> 00:40:15,003
You did have it in the trunk.

785
00:40:15,005 --> 00:40:17,806
Sorry I held it over you.

786
00:40:17,808 --> 00:40:19,842
Guess I owe you one.

787
00:40:19,844 --> 00:40:22,779
No, we're square, Art.

788
00:40:22,781 --> 00:40:25,681
Hey, you're not goingto hug me, are ya?

789
00:40:28,452 --> 00:40:29,886
See you in the morning.

790
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:55,880
Are you sure about this?

791
00:40:55,882 --> 00:40:58,916
Oh, man.

792
00:41:58,041 --> 00:42:00,275
Bloody mrs s. She's right.

793
00:42:00,277 --> 00:42:03,779
Really?

794
00:42:03,781 --> 00:42:05,280
What kind of mother am I

795
00:42:05,282 --> 00:42:06,815
if I snatch my own daughter?

796
00:42:06,817 --> 00:42:08,684
A crap one, I agree.

797
00:42:08,686 --> 00:42:13,889
And if I rob Alison,

798
00:42:13,891 --> 00:42:15,390
run now and never tell my...

799
00:42:15,392 --> 00:42:17,226
Clones?

800
00:42:17,228 --> 00:42:18,727
Oh, God, we do have to find

801
00:42:18,729 --> 00:42:20,229
another word for that.

802
00:42:20,231 --> 00:42:24,733
Don't tell them what,Sarah, what happened?

803
00:42:24,735 --> 00:42:26,402
After all this, you'rereally going to go

804
00:42:26,404 --> 00:42:27,904
and just give the moneyback to bitchface?

805
00:42:27,906 --> 00:42:32,642
Mrs s gave me one visit.

806
00:42:32,644 --> 00:42:34,777
I need to get it right.

807
00:42:34,779 --> 00:42:38,548
Okay, well,

808
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:40,817
this has taken yearsoff my life.

809
00:42:40,819 --> 00:42:43,119
Now can you please tell me

810
00:42:43,121 --> 00:42:45,288
what in the hellhappened to your face.

811
00:43:06,177 --> 00:43:07,177
Ah.

812
00:43:12,917 --> 00:43:14,050
Ah!
