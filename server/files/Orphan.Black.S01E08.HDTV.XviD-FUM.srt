그럼, 우리 엄마는왜 절 포기했을가요?

예?

520
00:39:42,369 --> 00:39:44,446
우리가 숨겨주던아이들 중 몇이칼튼의 거래망에서
들어온 애들 말이다

521

그런 아이들이

524
00:39:56,363 --> 00:39:59,227
의학실험의대상들이였다는 거였지

525
00:40:01,696 --> 00:40:02,131

소문이거든

528
00:40:15,743 --> 00:40:17,246
칼틀이 널 내게데려왔지

529
00:40:20,416 --> 00:40:22,384
그분이 제 생모를알고 있지 않았을까요?아마도, 그치만
그랬었더라도

530
00:40:24,857 --> 00:40:25,421
나한테 얘기안했을지도 모르지

531
00:40:27,244 --> 00:40:27,749

아줌마는 무슨 일이있었어요?

554
00:42:39,671 --> 00:42:52,940

안돼!

564
00:00:05,028 --> 00:00:07,280
Do you know this futurist,Dr. Aldous Leekie?

565
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,124
No.

566
00:00:08,244 --> 00:00:10,351
Neolution gives usthe opportunity

567
00:00:10,471 --> 00:00:13,439
at self-directedevolution.

568
00:00:13,441 --> 00:00:15,240
- Delphine.- Cosima.

569
00:00:15,242 --> 00:00:16,775
Because she doesn'tknow that I know.

570
00:00:16,777 --> 00:00:18,143
I'm  the one who'smonitoring  her.

571
00:00:18,145 --> 00:00:20,846
It's time we admit whatthis is really about?

572
00:00:20,848 --> 00:00:22,481
Did I make a huge mistake?

573
00:00:22,483 --> 00:00:23,882
I have to go.

574
00:00:23,884 --> 00:00:25,284
This is high-level shit, Sarah,

575
00:00:25,286 --> 00:00:26,952
an illegal human cloning trial.

576
00:00:26,954 --> 00:00:29,254
There's nine of you. No!There's only one of me.

577
00:00:29,256 --> 00:00:30,689
You have a problem.

578
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:32,658
- What kind of a problem?- She's not Beth.

579
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,259
You must be Olivier.The one who's killing us

580
00:00:34,261 --> 00:00:36,195
is Ukrainian, she's blonde,

581
00:00:36,197 --> 00:00:37,463
she's a religious nut.

582
00:00:37,465 --> 00:00:38,931
You arethe original.

583
00:00:38,933 --> 00:00:40,165
You are the light.

584
00:00:40,167 --> 00:00:42,601
I dreamed that we were friends.

585
00:00:42,603 --> 00:00:44,336
- We're not friends.- We will be.

586
00:00:44,338 --> 00:00:46,138
I have her, Aldous.

587
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,173
Get her ready to travel.I'll be there in the morning.

588
00:00:48,175 --> 00:00:50,442
I want to see

589
00:00:50,444 --> 00:00:51,643
your tail.

590
00:00:51,645 --> 00:00:53,112
Aaaaah!

591
00:00:53,114 --> 00:00:54,713
I need to talk to you about Beth Childs.

592
00:00:54,715 --> 00:00:55,814
Beth Childs?

593
00:00:55,816 --> 00:00:57,883
Let's go.Wrong number.

594
00:00:57,885 --> 00:00:59,351
We can't go backto the townhouse.

595
00:00:59,353 --> 00:01:01,220
It's not safe. They'llbe looking for us.

596
00:01:01,222 --> 00:01:02,855
Art, you got to see this.

597
00:01:02,857 --> 00:01:04,456
Who's Sarah Manning?

598
00:01:15,935 --> 00:01:17,336
Ready for this?

599
00:01:17,338 --> 00:01:19,204
You believe indoppelgangers, Angie?

600
00:01:19,206 --> 00:01:20,572
Doppelgangers running around

601
00:01:20,574 --> 00:01:23,242
to confusethe issue? No.

602
00:01:23,244 --> 00:01:24,643
How about twins?

603
00:01:24,645 --> 00:01:26,245
Beth ever mentiona twin sister?

604
00:01:26,247 --> 00:01:30,415
What the hell is going on?!

605
00:01:30,417 --> 00:01:32,484
Look, we identifiedSarah Manning

606
00:01:32,486 --> 00:01:33,919
as Jane Doe, so,

607
00:01:33,921 --> 00:01:35,554
come on, we got tomake a house call.

608
00:01:38,691 --> 00:01:40,559
Hey.

609
00:01:40,561 --> 00:01:42,594
You mind keepingthis between us?

610
00:01:42,596 --> 00:01:44,863
Just 'til we figure outwhat the hell it is.

611
00:01:44,865 --> 00:01:46,565
Yeah, sure.

612
00:01:46,567 --> 00:01:48,167
Yeah, sounds good to me.

613
00:01:48,169 --> 00:01:49,268
Thanks.

614
00:02:04,851 --> 00:02:07,219
We can't go backto the townhouse.

615
00:02:07,221 --> 00:02:09,721
Unh-unh.Shh shh shh shh.

616
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:18,730
Olivier's boss,Dr. Leekie,

00:02:18,732 --> 00:02:20,966
is flying in today. He'llbe looking for you.

618
00:02:20,968 --> 00:02:23,669
Okay.

619
00:02:23,671 --> 00:02:26,638
For a second, there,I forgot I was a clone.

620
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,042
He thinks you're the onekilling his clones.

621
00:02:34,581 --> 00:02:36,748
Oh. Sorry.

622
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,218
Couldn't afford lattesfor Bonnie and Clyde.

623
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,086
Morning, Fe.

624
00:02:41,088 --> 00:02:42,921
Can we torch this, please?

625
00:02:42,923 --> 00:02:45,023
What?

626
00:02:45,025 --> 00:02:46,391
Your psycho sister's coatsmells like low tide.

627
00:02:46,393 --> 00:02:48,727
Felix!

628
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:51,463
Sarah's going to have tohole up here for a while.

629
00:02:51,465 --> 00:02:53,632
You, too? Impingingon my creativity.

630
00:02:53,634 --> 00:02:54,633
Shagging in my bed.

631
00:03:00,741 --> 00:03:02,908
Alison.

632
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,743
Oh, brilliant! Invite her, too.Then, maybe, we can all

633
00:03:04,745 --> 00:03:07,446
cuddle up with weight watchersand "Grey's Anatomy."

634
00:03:07,448 --> 00:03:09,781
Hey. How wascouples' camp?

635
00:03:09,783 --> 00:03:11,149
I came back early.

636
00:03:11,151 --> 00:03:12,484
Cosima filled me in already

637
00:03:12,486 --> 00:03:14,720
and I'm taking a breakfrom you two.

638
00:03:14,722 --> 00:03:16,555
I need to getmy house together.

639
00:03:16,557 --> 00:03:18,257
Uh, isn't that what

640
00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:19,458
marriage counseling was for?

641
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,226
Donnie and I aregetting a divorce.

642
00:03:21,228 --> 00:03:22,227
What?

643
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:23,829
Oh, I'm fine.

644
00:03:23,831 --> 00:03:25,731
It's my decision.

645
00:03:25,733 --> 00:03:27,199
Everything is under control.

646
00:03:27,201 --> 00:03:29,101
Okay, now, I'm worried.

647
00:03:29,103 --> 00:03:30,969
Well, don't be.I can take care of myself

648
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:32,671
and I don't need...

649
00:03:32,673 --> 00:03:34,406
You helping me clear my deck

650
00:03:34,408 --> 00:03:36,341
of liars and spies.

651
00:03:36,343 --> 00:03:38,443
Alison, you don't knowwho your monitor is, okay?

652
00:03:38,445 --> 00:03:40,279
Don't fixate.

653
00:03:40,281 --> 00:03:42,047
I'm reclaiming my life, Sarah.

654
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:44,283
Please respect that.

655
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,361
Aynsley, what are you doing?

656
00:03:56,363 --> 00:03:57,629
Alison, you're home!

657
00:03:57,631 --> 00:03:59,531
I told you I wascoming back early.

658
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:01,667
But not today, silly.

659
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:03,168
I just cameto water the plants.

660
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,703
Did you?

661
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,673
I'll get it!

662
00:04:10,677 --> 00:04:12,377
Hey hey hey hey.What have I said

663
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:14,313
about answering thedoor on your own?

664
00:04:14,315 --> 00:04:16,548
Only when we invite someone.

665
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,583
Uh-huh, and we havenot, have we?

666
00:04:20,687 --> 00:04:23,655
Kira, go up to your room.

667
00:04:23,657 --> 00:04:24,923
Quick.

668
00:04:31,798 --> 00:04:33,131
Siobhan Sadler?

669
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:34,566
Who wants to know?

670
00:04:34,568 --> 00:04:36,535
Detectives Bell and Deangelis.

671
00:04:36,537 --> 00:04:38,470
Are you the legal guardian

672
00:04:38,472 --> 00:04:41,573
of Sarah Manning?

673
00:04:43,527 --> 00:04:47,150
Orphan Black 01x08Entangled Bank
Original Air Date May 18, 2013

674
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,411
Sarah's dead?

675
00:05:19,413 --> 00:05:22,114
I'm sorry.

676
00:05:22,116 --> 00:05:23,615
How?

677
00:05:23,617 --> 00:05:25,150
She was shot.

678
00:05:25,152 --> 00:05:27,419
Shot?

679
00:05:27,421 --> 00:05:29,721
When?

680
00:05:29,723 --> 00:05:31,723
On or around November 25th.

681
00:05:31,725 --> 00:05:34,493
November 25th?That's 2 weeks ago.

682
00:05:34,495 --> 00:05:36,395
Identification took some time.

683
00:05:36,397 --> 00:05:38,930
But you're sure it's her?

684
00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:44,736
Did you know if Sarahhad any problems

685
00:05:44,738 --> 00:05:46,271
with anyone?

686
00:05:46,273 --> 00:05:47,773
Women, especially,

687
00:05:47,775 --> 00:05:49,441
but not exclusively.

688
00:05:49,443 --> 00:05:51,217
Why would you ask that?

689
00:05:53,246 --> 00:05:54,679
I'm sorry.

690
00:05:54,681 --> 00:05:56,148
We can't share muchabout the investigation,

691
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,516
at this point.

692
00:05:57,518 --> 00:05:59,618
Did she live here with you?

693
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,254
No. She came of age andshe moved out years ago.

694
00:06:02,256 --> 00:06:04,523
We aren't...

695
00:06:04,525 --> 00:06:06,358
We weren't close.

696
00:06:07,994 --> 00:06:09,428
Did Sarah have a sister?

697
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,296
No, she was an orphan.

698
00:06:11,298 --> 00:06:14,099
Could  she have a sister?

699
00:06:14,101 --> 00:06:15,600
If she did, it would be news

700
00:06:15,602 --> 00:06:17,202
to both of us.

701
00:06:19,705 --> 00:06:22,808
Neolution is bullshit, Cosima.

702
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,142
No, it isn't, Sarah.

703
00:06:24,144 --> 00:06:25,644
It's an applied philosophy

704
00:06:25,646 --> 00:06:27,312
with profound implications for what I do.

705
00:06:27,314 --> 00:06:28,747
So you'd go around

706
00:06:28,749 --> 00:06:30,115
blackbagging your subjects?

707
00:06:30,117 --> 00:06:33,518
That was mistaken identity, okay?

708
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,353
Olivier thought youwere the killer, Sarah.

709
00:06:35,355 --> 00:06:37,856
Yeah, well, your good friendDr. Leekie's on his way.

710
00:06:37,858 --> 00:06:39,157
Can I expect the same from him?

711
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:40,258
Okay, you know what?

712
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,160
You were the onewho turned our killer

713
00:06:42,162 --> 00:06:43,762
against our creators.

714
00:06:43,764 --> 00:06:46,298
I mean, why the hell wouldyou bring Helena into the mix?

715
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,101
Oi! Ivory tower!This all happened

716
00:06:49,103 --> 00:06:51,169
because  you  gotthe science wrong.

717
00:06:51,171 --> 00:06:53,171
No, I didn't.

718
00:06:53,173 --> 00:06:55,140
Yes, you did, okay?

719
00:06:55,142 --> 00:06:57,209
They knew I wasn't Beth,from the medical tests.

720
00:06:57,211 --> 00:06:59,678
You said our DNA was identical.

721
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,012
It is. You know, maybe it was

722
00:07:01,014 --> 00:07:02,380
your sunny personality that gave you away.

723
00:07:02,382 --> 00:07:04,549
Whose bloody sideare you on, Cosima?

724
00:07:04,551 --> 00:07:06,151
Oh, hang up!She's a Freaky Leekie.

725
00:07:06,153 --> 00:07:07,819
D...

726
00:07:07,821 --> 00:07:11,323
Shit! Fe, Cosima drankthe purple kool-aid.

727
00:07:11,325 --> 00:07:13,125
Well, then, to hell with her.

728
00:07:13,127 --> 00:07:15,727
You can still save Alison.

729
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:17,005
Alison's fine.

730
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,898
She's not fine.She's divorcing Donnie.

731
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,800
Every freakfor herself.

732
00:07:21,802 --> 00:07:23,902
Divorces do really strangethings to normals, Sarah.

733
00:07:23,904 --> 00:07:25,537
They lose their fake happiness,

734
00:07:25,539 --> 00:07:27,305
they forget the wayto the mall,

735
00:07:27,307 --> 00:07:29,341
and then, they come downtownto find themselves.

736
00:07:32,812 --> 00:07:34,479
She's obsessing that one

737
00:07:34,481 --> 00:07:36,214
of her bitchy friendsis her monitor.

738
00:07:36,216 --> 00:07:37,849
Aynsley.

739
00:07:38,952 --> 00:07:40,797
It's her, for sure.

740
00:07:41,821 --> 00:07:45,891
Whew, divorce.You poor thing.

741
00:07:45,893 --> 00:07:47,325
Where are the kids?

742
00:07:47,327 --> 00:07:48,760
They're at my mother's.

743
00:07:48,762 --> 00:07:50,428
Do they know?Did you tell them?

744
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,930
You're just full ofquestions, aren't you?

745
00:07:51,932 --> 00:07:53,298
Well, of course I am.

746
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,799
I care about you.

747
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:56,334
I knew you were unhappy, but...

748
00:07:56,336 --> 00:07:57,502
How did you know?

749
00:07:57,504 --> 00:07:59,237
By asking questions.

750
00:07:59,239 --> 00:08:00,539
Always asking, asking.

751
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,974
Everything you know,you pried right out of me.

752
00:08:09,115 --> 00:08:10,782
Here's a thought...

753
00:08:10,784 --> 00:08:13,118
Why don't you let  me  coachfigure skating tonight?

754
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,620
The kids are with your mom.

755
00:08:15,622 --> 00:08:17,222
Have a night in, relax.

756
00:08:17,224 --> 00:08:19,124
No, you relax.Figure skating is

757
00:08:19,126 --> 00:08:21,226
on  my  schedule andwhether my daughter is

758
00:08:21,228 --> 00:08:22,727
in attendance or not,I'll be there.

759
00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:27,032
Ally, I think youneed some "me" time.

760
00:08:27,034 --> 00:08:29,434
And I think you need to giveme my house keys back.

761
00:08:29,436 --> 00:08:31,570
What?!What have I done?

762
00:08:31,572 --> 00:08:33,305
Keys, please.

763
00:08:38,044 --> 00:08:39,477
I know you're in pain,

764
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:41,446
so I won't askfor my keys back,

765
00:08:41,448 --> 00:08:43,648
but I want you to know I won't

766
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,517
abandon you, Ally.

767
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,660
You know...

768
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,465
I'm afraid restoringyour brother's, uh,

769
00:09:00,467 --> 00:09:03,602
appendage wasout of the question.

770
00:09:03,604 --> 00:09:05,303
The tail was too badly damaged.

771
00:09:05,305 --> 00:09:07,906
Must've been a new one for you.

772
00:09:07,908 --> 00:09:09,307
Yes, but fascinating, actually.

773
00:09:09,309 --> 00:09:11,409
That level of surgicalenhancement...

774
00:09:11,411 --> 00:09:13,078
He's very committed.

775
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,113
How long do you expectto keep him here?

776
00:09:15,115 --> 00:09:16,848
Between the blood lossand the risk

777
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:19,017
of infectionin that... area,

778
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:20,385
a few days to a week.

779
00:09:20,387 --> 00:09:21,486
Thanks, doc.

780
00:09:21,488 --> 00:09:22,988
I'll wait 'til he comes to.

781
00:09:44,143 --> 00:09:46,711
Where are you with Cosima?

782
00:09:46,713 --> 00:09:49,681
Closer.

783
00:09:49,683 --> 00:09:51,783
She...

784
00:09:51,785 --> 00:09:54,319
She made a pass at me, Aldous.

785
00:09:54,321 --> 00:09:56,554
Really?

786
00:09:56,556 --> 00:09:58,823
Yes.

787
00:09:58,825 --> 00:10:02,594
Delphine,

788
00:10:02,596 --> 00:10:05,597
Cosima's safety is at stake.

789
00:10:05,599 --> 00:10:07,999
Other subjects, too.

790
00:10:08,001 --> 00:10:09,734
I need to know

791
00:10:09,736 --> 00:10:13,738
which ones she'sin contact with.

792
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,741
But  she  has toinitiate disclosure.

793
00:10:16,743 --> 00:10:20,445
I'm not saying disclose.

794
00:10:20,447 --> 00:10:22,747
This is a direct threat,so I need you

795
00:10:22,749 --> 00:10:25,150
to dig deeper and faster.

796
00:11:23,609 --> 00:11:25,210
"Dear Mummy

797
00:11:25,212 --> 00:11:27,145
I miss you.

798
00:11:27,147 --> 00:11:28,713
Mrs. S. Says you

799
00:11:28,715 --> 00:11:31,449
are in the sunshine...

800
00:11:31,451 --> 00:11:33,818
Please come home.

801
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,054
Love,

802
00:11:36,056 --> 00:11:38,823
Kira".

803
00:11:46,466 --> 00:11:48,933
Oi! Can you not,please?

804
00:11:48,935 --> 00:11:50,602
I'm not going tohole up with you,

805
00:11:50,604 --> 00:11:51,970
if you can't sit still.

806
00:11:51,972 --> 00:11:53,338
Does it smell?

807
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,773
Yeah! It smellslike a foot.

808
00:11:54,775 --> 00:11:56,908
Only worse, because it's yours.

809
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,610
Alison's not picking up.

810
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,414
Who's calling?

811
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,649
Art. Again.

812
00:12:04,651 --> 00:12:07,152
Sorry, Beth doesn'tlive here anymore.

813
00:12:07,154 --> 00:12:09,230
No, she lives with me.

814
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,760
So does herboytoy bodyguard.

815
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,087
Stop! Would youplease stop!

816
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,460
Pl...

817
00:12:15,462 --> 00:12:16,861
Oi-oi, Mrs S.

818
00:12:16,863 --> 00:12:18,096
Oi-oi.

819
00:12:20,299 --> 00:12:22,600
And you're alive.

820
00:12:22,602 --> 00:12:24,469
Yeah. Why?

821
00:12:24,471 --> 00:12:28,139
Two homicide detectiveson my doorstep this morning,

822
00:12:28,141 --> 00:12:30,508
quite convinced they'dfound  your  body

823
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:33,778
in a gravel quarry.

824
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,280
Who wants mimosas?

825
00:12:35,282 --> 00:12:37,449
Sit down and shut your gob!

826
00:12:37,451 --> 00:12:39,818
I was temptedto claim the remains

827
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,219
and feed themto you both on toast.

828
00:12:41,221 --> 00:12:43,154
Would you care to enlighten me?

829
00:12:43,156 --> 00:12:44,956
I don't want to lie to you, so,

830
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,057
not yet.

831
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:47,692
What'd they say?

832
00:12:47,694 --> 00:12:49,227
Very little.

833
00:12:49,229 --> 00:12:51,296
I'd venture littleis all they have.

834
00:12:51,298 --> 00:12:53,798
Thanks.

835
00:12:58,504 --> 00:13:00,939
Whatever is going on,if it takes

836
00:13:00,941 --> 00:13:05,877
one step towards Kira,you need to yell fire.

837
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:07,078
The home we've builtfor ourselves

838
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,480
in this country,

839
00:13:08,482 --> 00:13:11,149
we burn it all down,if we have to.

840
00:13:11,151 --> 00:13:14,285
That's a promise.

841
00:13:18,057 --> 00:13:19,224
Hey.

842
00:13:19,226 --> 00:13:21,559
Hey, facial reconstruction'scoming along.

843
00:13:21,561 --> 00:13:23,328
Yeah, well, hang onto your hat.

844
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,496
Sounds promising.

845
00:13:24,498 --> 00:13:27,031
Sarah Manning offedherself, jumped in front

846
00:13:27,033 --> 00:13:28,533
of a train at Huxley Station.

847
00:13:28,535 --> 00:13:30,101
What?!

848
00:13:30,103 --> 00:13:31,903
Check out the time of death.

849
00:13:31,905 --> 00:13:34,405
Two days beforeJane Doe was shot.

850
00:13:34,407 --> 00:13:35,740
Jane Doe can't beSarah Manning.

851
00:13:35,742 --> 00:13:37,775
Sarah Manning was already dead.

852
00:13:37,777 --> 00:13:39,110
Except, the prints match.

853
00:13:39,112 --> 00:13:41,346
Twins, right? Twins.Twins' prints are

854
00:13:41,348 --> 00:13:42,547
close enough to flag a match.

855
00:13:42,549 --> 00:13:44,249
I mean, environmentalfactors like

856
00:13:44,251 --> 00:13:45,416
wear and tear canusually differentiate.

857
00:13:45,418 --> 00:13:46,885
Okay, but the fostermother said no relations.

858
00:13:46,887 --> 00:13:48,253
That she knew of.

859
00:13:48,255 --> 00:13:49,654
Sarah was an orphan.

860
00:13:49,656 --> 00:13:51,422
Say Beth's a triplet,separated at birth.

861
00:13:51,424 --> 00:13:54,192
Come on, humor me.Over a couple of days,

862
00:13:54,194 --> 00:13:56,528
same city, one suicides,the other gets whacked?

863
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:57,962
I mean, it suggeststhey're in touch,

864
00:13:57,964 --> 00:13:59,397
that they're not separateanymore, right?

865
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,199
And there's only oneleft to clear it up.

866
00:14:04,203 --> 00:14:05,203
Beth!

867
00:14:05,205 --> 00:14:06,905
Hey. Got yourmessages.

868
00:14:06,907 --> 00:14:08,873
Bad time?

869
00:14:11,774 --> 00:14:13,741
So what's this all about?

870
00:14:13,743 --> 00:14:15,510
You miss me already?

871
00:14:15,512 --> 00:14:17,412
Some questions came upabout your work

872
00:14:17,414 --> 00:14:18,947
on the Jane Doe case.

873
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:23,418
Such as?

874
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,853
Well, you told us there was

875
00:14:24,855 --> 00:14:26,321
no print match on the victim.

876
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:27,498
Yeah, there wasn't.

877
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:29,293
Well, there's noconfirmation of that

878
00:14:29,413 --> 00:14:30,822
in the case file.

879
00:14:30,942 --> 00:14:32,235
There should be.

880
00:14:32,355 --> 00:14:34,912
Well, we ran them againand we got a match.

881
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,935
So, we're finallygetting somewhere.

882
00:14:40,937 --> 00:14:42,403
Yeah, it sounds like it.

883
00:14:42,405 --> 00:14:44,506
Just need to know...

884
00:14:51,814 --> 00:14:54,082
Is this a joke?

885
00:14:54,084 --> 00:14:55,250
Does the name

886
00:14:55,252 --> 00:14:57,185
Sarah Manningmean anything to you?

887
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:59,554
Who the hell is this?

888
00:14:59,556 --> 00:15:01,022
You've never seen her before?

889
00:15:01,024 --> 00:15:03,024
Uh, uh, yeah, yeah,

890
00:15:03,026 --> 00:15:05,059
in the mirror.

891
00:15:05,061 --> 00:15:07,195
Come on. No!

892
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,463
Hey, I guess peoplehave lookalikes.

893
00:15:08,465 --> 00:15:09,664
Do they?

894
00:15:11,534 --> 00:15:13,268
Alison!

895
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,036
Alison, how are you?

896
00:15:15,038 --> 00:15:16,037
Hmm?

897
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:17,539
Oh, poor hon.

898
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,747
If you need anything,just call.

899
00:15:19,867 --> 00:15:21,276
Why can't youjust support me

900
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:22,710
in what I'm trying to do?This is important to me.

901
00:15:22,712 --> 00:15:24,779
You can't just put onan outfit and be a coach.

902
00:15:24,781 --> 00:15:26,281
You're not their coach. Youdon't know what you're doing.

903
00:15:26,283 --> 00:15:28,598
- I am here every single...- Ally! Hey!

904
00:15:28,718 --> 00:15:29,784
Hi, Chad.

905
00:15:29,786 --> 00:15:31,252
Singlehood.Free at last, huh?

906
00:15:31,254 --> 00:15:32,787
What are you doinghere, Aynsley?

907
00:15:32,789 --> 00:15:35,390
I know, right?

908
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,258
Chad, go playwith your dumbbells.

909
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,893
I told you I'vegot this covered.

910
00:15:38,895 --> 00:15:40,962
You're in no conditionto be coaching kids.

911
00:15:40,964 --> 00:15:41,996
Way to rub saltin the wounds, Ayns.

912
00:15:44,734 --> 00:15:48,169
Sorry, I tried.

913
00:15:48,171 --> 00:15:51,005
I'm perfectly fineand no one asked you

914
00:15:51,007 --> 00:15:52,941
to sub for me, so leave.

915
00:15:52,943 --> 00:15:55,944
Alison, you're madat Donnie, not me.

916
00:15:55,946 --> 00:15:57,512
I told you to stayaway from me.

917
00:15:57,514 --> 00:16:00,048
And I told youyou're not yourself.

918
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:01,616
I know what you'redoing, Aynsley.

919
00:16:01,618 --> 00:16:03,217
You want to mess with my life?

920
00:16:03,219 --> 00:16:05,086
I'm going to mess with yours.

921
00:16:10,793 --> 00:16:12,293
Sorry to be a bitch, here,

922
00:16:12,295 --> 00:16:14,162
but it looks like you buried

923
00:16:14,164 --> 00:16:15,930
Jane Doe's fingerprintsto hide your connection.

924
00:16:15,932 --> 00:16:17,131
What connection?

925
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:18,433
I don't have a sister.

926
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:19,767
I don't knowwho this person is.

927
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:21,703
Sarah Manning was an orphan.

928
00:16:21,705 --> 00:16:23,538
Same prints asJane Doe, but she

929
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,040
killed herself days beforeJane Doe was murdered.

930
00:16:27,643 --> 00:16:28,943
Look, Beth,

931
00:16:28,945 --> 00:16:31,679
we just need to knowwhere you fit in.

932
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,217
Can I see her file?

933
00:16:36,219 --> 00:16:37,485
Sorry,

934
00:16:37,487 --> 00:16:38,720
you're a civilian.

935
00:16:38,722 --> 00:16:40,555
Yeah, what you always wanted.

936
00:16:44,026 --> 00:16:48,296
Art, do I needto lawyer up, here?

937
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:51,332
I don't know, Beth.

938
00:16:51,334 --> 00:16:52,567
Do you?

939
00:17:07,182 --> 00:17:09,050
Have forensics run her prints

940
00:17:09,052 --> 00:17:11,285
as fast as possible.

941
00:17:11,287 --> 00:17:12,820
You got it.

942
00:17:41,717 --> 00:17:44,519
Oh, shit.

943
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:47,555
Okay, fine, you caught me.

944
00:17:47,557 --> 00:17:49,557
Just please don't narcon me to Aynsley.

945
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:52,767
You know how apeshit she getsabout stuff like this.

946
00:17:54,898 --> 00:17:57,632
Whoa.

947
00:17:57,634 --> 00:17:58,733
Alison.

948
00:17:58,735 --> 00:18:00,234
You know, Chad,this is the first hit

949
00:18:00,236 --> 00:18:03,838
I've had since"Godspell" in college.

950
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,008
I don't know what that is.

951
00:18:08,644 --> 00:18:11,012
Okay.

952
00:18:11,014 --> 00:18:12,814
You got any more?

953
00:18:18,921 --> 00:18:22,590
Paul.

954
00:18:22,592 --> 00:18:24,092
Dr. Aldous Leekiewill be here

955
00:18:24,094 --> 00:18:26,494
in a couple hours.

956
00:18:26,496 --> 00:18:29,097
He texted you.

957
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:33,501
You are conspiring

958
00:18:33,503 --> 00:18:34,936
with at least two clones.

959
00:18:34,938 --> 00:18:36,738
Just one, actually.

960
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,940
Are you crazy?

961
00:18:38,942 --> 00:18:42,443
Despite appearances,I'm not the one

962
00:18:42,445 --> 00:18:47,482
in a compromisingposition, here, Paul.

963
00:18:47,484 --> 00:18:50,685
You blackmailed

964
00:18:50,687 --> 00:18:52,353
an ex-military-intelligence guy

965
00:18:52,355 --> 00:18:55,223
to do your dirty work.

966
00:18:55,225 --> 00:18:58,659
Olivier Duval...

967
00:18:58,661 --> 00:19:03,164
that's a classy pseudonym, bro.

968
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,333
Thank you.

969
00:19:05,335 --> 00:19:09,303
Your real name is Kevin;

970
00:19:09,305 --> 00:19:11,606
you're from Wenatchee,Washington;

971
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:14,642
and you have a raftof unsavory sex warrants.

972
00:19:14,644 --> 00:19:17,545
The organization knows that.

973
00:19:17,547 --> 00:19:19,046
Yeah, but the police don't.

974
00:19:19,048 --> 00:19:22,817
And that's why you'regoing to listen

975
00:19:22,819 --> 00:19:25,119
when I tell you whathappened last night.

976
00:19:30,392 --> 00:19:32,860
Oh, I get it.

977
00:19:32,862 --> 00:19:34,896
Smoke through the roof...

978
00:19:34,898 --> 00:19:36,731
Accelerated dissipation.

979
00:19:36,733 --> 00:19:37,732
Mm.

980
00:19:37,734 --> 00:19:40,768
Mm-hmm.

981
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:42,970
Fewer air fresheners required.

982
00:19:42,972 --> 00:19:44,639
Speaking of fresh air...

983
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,340
cheers to finallygetting Donnie

984
00:19:46,342 --> 00:19:48,242
off your couch.

985
00:19:48,244 --> 00:19:51,112
Are you mocking the failure

986
00:19:51,114 --> 00:19:52,647
of my marriage, Chad?

987
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:54,682
Sorry.

988
00:19:54,684 --> 00:19:56,184
No, don't be.

989
00:19:56,186 --> 00:19:58,419
I gather you and Aynsley

990
00:19:58,421 --> 00:20:00,321
aren't exactly booking nooners.

991
00:20:00,323 --> 00:20:02,190
Eh, you know,

992
00:20:02,192 --> 00:20:03,791
the thing about youand me, Hendrix...

993
00:20:03,793 --> 00:20:06,027
Hmm?

994
00:20:06,029 --> 00:20:09,030
We're sharks... we stopmoving, we die.

995
00:20:09,032 --> 00:20:10,298
Hmm.

996
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,067
Well, you certainlygot that down.

997
00:20:13,069 --> 00:20:16,604
Those late-night runsin your sleeveless tees.

998
00:20:16,606 --> 00:20:20,141
You ain't so bad yourself.

999
00:20:20,143 --> 00:20:22,076
Tight glutes.

1000
00:20:22,078 --> 00:20:23,177
Nice pecs.

1001
00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:25,012
I bet you could benchpress me.

1002
00:20:25,014 --> 00:20:27,114
Easy.

1003
00:20:28,817 --> 00:20:31,886
Bet you could bounce melike a ball.

1004
00:20:31,888 --> 00:20:35,957
Okay.

1005
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:37,458
Maybe you've had too much.

1006
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,826
Hmm.

1007
00:20:38,828 --> 00:20:42,230
Maybe you haven't had enough.

1008
00:20:42,232 --> 00:20:44,432
What are we doing, here?

1009
00:20:44,434 --> 00:20:45,833
I'm objectifying you.

1010
00:20:45,835 --> 00:20:47,802
Sexually.

1011
00:20:47,804 --> 00:20:50,171
To get back at Donnie.

1012
00:20:50,173 --> 00:20:52,874
I should really havea problem with this.

1013
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:57,311
But you don't.

1014
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:11,692
Hey, Delphine.

1015
00:21:11,694 --> 00:21:13,094
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

1016
00:21:13,096 --> 00:21:15,096
Oh, no no no.No, impossible.

1017
00:21:15,098 --> 00:21:17,732
So, apparently,I've got this thing

1018
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:20,401
for, like, jumpingto conclusions.

1019
00:21:20,403 --> 00:21:24,372
You know, it's justthat I've never...

1020
00:21:24,374 --> 00:21:26,440
I know, I know,I know, you're not gay

1021
00:21:26,442 --> 00:21:27,842
and I'm a total idiot.

1022
00:21:27,844 --> 00:21:29,277
So sorry.

1023
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:31,612
Oh, let me...

1024
00:21:31,614 --> 00:21:32,613
Oh, yes.

1025
00:21:32,615 --> 00:21:33,915
- Do you...?- Yeah.

1026
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,917
I just want to make, like,

1027
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,885
crazy science with you.

1028
00:21:37,887 --> 00:21:40,288
Totally crazy science.

1029
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:42,623
I'm so glad to hear thatbecause you know what?

1030
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:45,092
I was reading upon the Dyad Institute

1031
00:21:45,094 --> 00:21:47,361
and did you knowthat, Dr. Leekie,

1032
00:21:47,363 --> 00:21:49,130
he has builta dedicated department

1033
00:21:49,132 --> 00:21:52,099
for transgenic organtransplants? And...

1034
00:21:52,101 --> 00:21:55,136
Sorry, I was justdorking out so hard

1035
00:21:55,138 --> 00:21:58,039
to their extrapolationof murine models.

1036
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:59,573
What?!

1037
00:21:59,575 --> 00:22:01,542
Yeah.

1038
00:22:01,544 --> 00:22:02,677
Oh, wow.

1039
00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:04,245
You know, it's really,really good

1040
00:22:04,247 --> 00:22:06,213
to finally meetsomeone who gets it.

1041
00:22:06,215 --> 00:22:07,248
Hmm.

1042
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:12,320
Who gets me.

1043
00:22:12,322 --> 00:22:14,422
Yeah, ditto.

1044
00:22:14,424 --> 00:22:15,489
Obvs.

1045
00:22:20,028 --> 00:22:22,663
I can't stop thinkingabout that kiss.

1046
00:22:22,665 --> 00:22:26,400
Like ina not-bad way?

1047
00:22:26,402 --> 00:22:28,669
Oh, like

1048
00:22:28,671 --> 00:22:30,504
I've never thoughtabout bisexuality.

1049
00:22:30,506 --> 00:22:31,872
I mean, for myself, you know?

1050
00:22:31,874 --> 00:22:33,307
But as a scientist, I know that

1051
00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:35,743
sexuality is a spectrum.

1052
00:22:35,745 --> 00:22:37,178
But, you know, social biases,

1053
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:40,147
they codified attraction.

1054
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:42,483
It's contrary to thebiological facts,

1055
00:22:42,485 --> 00:22:43,951
you know?

1056
00:22:43,953 --> 00:22:47,455
Mm-hmm. That'soddly romantic.

1057
00:22:51,893 --> 00:22:53,728
Totally encouraging.

1058
00:23:20,288 --> 00:23:21,555
Oh, God!

1059
00:23:22,992 --> 00:23:25,059

Caucasian female,suicide by train.

00:25:19,966 --> 00:25:21,632
You processed thebody and its release.

1108
00:25:21,634 --> 00:25:23,201
I process lotsof bodies.

1109
00:25:23,203 --> 00:25:25,269
Is there a problem?

1110
00:25:25,271 --> 00:25:27,572
Fingerprints from our Jane Doe

1111
00:25:27,574 --> 00:25:29,073
of the gravel crusher.

1112
00:25:29,075 --> 00:25:30,408
Forensics says they'respooky-close

1113
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:31,743
to two other women.

1114
00:25:31,745 --> 00:25:33,111
Yeah, one's Sarah Manning.

1115
00:25:33,113 --> 00:25:35,913
The other is a...totally other woman.

1116
00:25:35,915 --> 00:25:38,382
Let's see.Uh...

1117
00:25:38,384 --> 00:25:42,220
Sarah Manning.Suicide by train.

1118
00:25:42,222 --> 00:25:45,022
Holy shit.

1119
00:25:45,024 --> 00:25:47,291
It's uncanny.

1120
00:25:47,293 --> 00:25:49,961
We need the nameand the address

1121
00:25:49,963 --> 00:25:51,496
of the person whoidentified her.

1122
00:25:57,903 --> 00:25:59,170
What?! I...

1123
00:25:59,172 --> 00:26:01,205
Okay, Colin, please slow down.

1124
00:26:01,207 --> 00:26:02,573
What, exactly, did they say?

1125
00:26:02,575 --> 00:26:03,975
I couldn't lie, Felix, okay?

1126
00:26:03,977 --> 00:26:07,044
There are records.Your signature, address.

1127
00:26:07,046 --> 00:26:08,246
Okay,

1128
00:26:08,248 --> 00:26:10,615
I've got to go,

1129
00:26:10,617 --> 00:26:11,983
but you just take a hot bath.

1130
00:26:11,985 --> 00:26:14,285
I'll talk to you later.

1131
00:26:14,287 --> 00:26:15,453
Shit! Sarah.

1132
00:26:15,455 --> 00:26:16,888
You can handle this, yeah?

1133
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:18,956
Cops? Yeah.I... yeah.

1134
00:26:18,958 --> 00:26:20,391
Where are you going to go?

1135
00:26:20,393 --> 00:26:23,294
No idea.

1136
00:26:25,398 --> 00:26:26,464
Shit!

1137
00:26:26,466 --> 00:26:28,566
Felix!

1138
00:26:28,568 --> 00:26:29,934
It's me, Alison!

1139
00:26:29,936 --> 00:26:31,335
Please be home.

1140
00:26:36,141 --> 00:26:38,910
You're effing kidding me.

1141
00:26:38,912 --> 00:26:40,711
Bad things have happened to me.

1142
00:26:40,713 --> 00:26:42,914
And I would loveto hear about them,

1143
00:26:42,916 --> 00:26:44,315
I would, but, right now,

1144
00:26:44,317 --> 00:26:45,683
you need to go.

1145
00:26:45,685 --> 00:26:46,784
What?

1146
00:26:50,856 --> 00:26:53,958
I can't go back there.

1147
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,760
It's just for onenight, Alison.

1148
00:26:55,762 --> 00:27:00,231
I slept with Aynsley's husband.

1149
00:27:00,233 --> 00:27:01,566
What?

1150
00:27:01,568 --> 00:27:05,837
I shagged Chad.

1151
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:07,405
Then Aynsley attacked me

1152
00:27:07,407 --> 00:27:09,240
in the middle of the street.

1153
00:27:09,242 --> 00:27:10,675
I degraded myself

1154
00:27:10,677 --> 00:27:12,076
and I disgraced my children

1155
00:27:12,078 --> 00:27:13,678
and I can't go back there.

1156
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,415
I seriously underestimated you.

1157
00:27:17,417 --> 00:27:19,617
I hope you kicked her arse.

1158
00:27:19,619 --> 00:27:21,652
I did.

1159
00:27:21,654 --> 00:27:24,455
Kind of.

1160
00:27:24,457 --> 00:27:26,390
I don't want to divorce Donnie,

1161
00:27:26,392 --> 00:27:30,061
but I can't keep lyingto him and I hate

1162
00:27:30,063 --> 00:27:31,796
lying to my kids, I hate it!

1163
00:27:31,798 --> 00:27:34,632
How can we possiblysustain this insanity?

1164
00:27:34,634 --> 00:27:36,267
We can't.

1165
00:27:36,269 --> 00:27:38,069
I don't know if Art'sgoing to throw me in jail

1166
00:27:38,071 --> 00:27:40,605
or if Cosima's going tonarc us out

1167
00:27:40,607 --> 00:27:43,941
to the Neolutionists, or what.

1168
00:27:43,943 --> 00:27:46,711
Don't forget Helena.She's always fun.

1169
00:27:46,713 --> 00:27:50,848
All I know is I cameback to fix things,

1170
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:52,583
be a real mum to Kira.

1171
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:58,489
So what if we tell them?

1172
00:27:58,491 --> 00:28:01,292
You mean come out?

1173
00:28:13,439 --> 00:28:14,972
"I miss you

1174
00:28:14,974 --> 00:28:16,207
Mummy".

1175
00:28:16,209 --> 00:28:19,377
"I miss you Mummy."

1176
00:28:19,379 --> 00:28:21,746
"I miss youMummy."

1177
00:28:21,748 --> 00:28:23,114
"I miss you Mummy."

1178
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,091
Scotsburn Avenue.

1179
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,867
148.

1180
00:28:39,798 --> 00:28:42,266
Dr. Baker to pediatrics, please.

1181
00:28:42,268 --> 00:28:44,835
Dr. Baker.

1182
00:28:48,133 --> 00:28:50,331
I replaced yoursecurity footage

1183
00:28:50,451 --> 00:28:52,143
to show only one clone.

1184
00:28:52,145 --> 00:28:54,453
Beth... Sarah...Was never there.

1185
00:28:54,573 --> 00:28:56,288
He's smart.It won't work.

1186
00:28:56,408 --> 00:28:57,790
It will, if you stick to one.

1187
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,373
There was only one.

1188
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,920
And you needto stop blaming yourself.

1189
00:29:02,922 --> 00:29:05,189
How could you know?

1190
00:29:05,191 --> 00:29:06,357
Uh,

1191
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:07,658
Dr. Leekie,I'm...

1192
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,160
Paul Dierden.

1193
00:29:09,162 --> 00:29:10,594
I hear great things.

1194
00:29:10,596 --> 00:29:12,730
Aldous.

1195
00:29:12,732 --> 00:29:14,565
Aldous, she took my tail.

1196
00:29:14,567 --> 00:29:17,134
Shut up, Olivier.

1197
00:29:24,142 --> 00:29:26,444
Are you okay?

1198
00:29:26,446 --> 00:29:29,213
Yes.

1199
00:29:30,683 --> 00:29:32,984
Are you sure?

1200
00:29:36,522 --> 00:29:41,292
I...I cry after sexwith boys, too.

1201
00:29:41,294 --> 00:29:43,745
Poor you.

1202
00:29:45,563 --> 00:29:47,331
But you know what?

1203
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:48,398
Hmm?

1204
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,369
I am never this hungry.

1205
00:29:52,371 --> 00:29:54,438
I could killfor some ice cream.

1206
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,407
Mmm. Okay.

1207
00:29:57,409 --> 00:29:58,775
Your wish is my command.

1208
00:29:58,777 --> 00:30:01,278
I'm going to goto the store and I'm

1209
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,680
going to get ussome Eskimo Pies.

1210
00:30:03,682 --> 00:30:04,882
Eskimo?

1211
00:30:06,251 --> 00:30:08,051
Yeah.

1212
00:30:08,053 --> 00:30:09,419
I don't think I know it.

1213
00:30:09,421 --> 00:30:10,687
- No?- No.

1214
00:30:10,689 --> 00:30:12,389
Prepare yourself.

1215
00:30:12,391 --> 00:30:15,092
You're about to becomea craven addict.

1216
00:30:15,094 --> 00:30:17,294
I think I already am.

1217
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,475
Merde.

1218
00:31:47,485 --> 00:31:49,820
She dropped the Beth actcold right in front of us.

1219
00:31:49,822 --> 00:31:53,357
If it weren't for Paul,she would've killed me.

1220
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:54,992
She said her name was Helena

1221
00:31:54,994 --> 00:31:58,362
and she had an accent,slavic.

1222
00:31:58,364 --> 00:31:59,963
She admitted she killed Beth

1223
00:31:59,965 --> 00:32:01,565
and took over her life.

1224
00:32:01,567 --> 00:32:06,703
Aldous, she iscompletely insane.

1225
00:32:06,705 --> 00:32:08,405
Welcome to the big picture.

1226
00:32:08,407 --> 00:32:09,806
Yes, sir.

1227
00:32:09,808 --> 00:32:12,242
Sorry, guys.

1228
00:32:12,244 --> 00:32:13,677
Visiting hours are over.

1229
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,346
Oh, sure. We'll getout of your way.

1230
00:32:22,053 --> 00:32:26,223
You just rest and heal.

1231
00:32:30,862 --> 00:32:33,830
What do they sayin the military,

1232
00:32:33,832 --> 00:32:36,266
"you've proven your mettle"?

1233
00:32:36,268 --> 00:32:38,268
No, sir, nobody ever said that.

1234
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,469
Okay.

1235
00:32:39,471 --> 00:32:40,637
Well, tomorrow,

1236
00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:43,807
I'd like to talkabout next steps.

1237
00:32:43,809 --> 00:32:47,344
Excuse me.

1238
00:32:47,346 --> 00:32:48,445
Found something?

1239
00:32:48,447 --> 00:32:50,681
Promise me Cosima's safe.

1240
00:32:50,683 --> 00:32:54,151
Her quest, Aldous,it's all perfectly...

1241
00:32:54,153 --> 00:32:55,485
perfectly natural.

1242
00:32:55,487 --> 00:32:56,620
Delphine,

1243
00:32:56,622 --> 00:32:59,056
believe me, I'm protecting her.

1244
00:32:59,058 --> 00:33:00,957
Now, what is it?

1245
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:03,293
Well, she's not onlyresearching her own biology,

1246
00:33:03,295 --> 00:33:05,595
but she is aware of...of eight others.

1247
00:33:05,597 --> 00:33:07,864
She's had contact.

1248
00:33:07,866 --> 00:33:09,700
I need names.

1249
00:33:09,702 --> 00:33:12,202
Okay, yes. Well, someof them seem to be dead.

1250
00:33:12,204 --> 00:33:14,071

1251
00:33:14,073 --> 00:33:15,272

1253
00:33:16,475 --> 00:33:17,708
Yes.

1254
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:18,875

1255
00:33:18,877 --> 00:33:19,943
Yes.

1256
00:33:19,945 --> 00:33:21,912
Helena. There is no last name.

1257
00:33:21,914 --> 00:33:23,046
Helena.

1258
00:33:23,048 --> 00:33:25,749
There's Alison Hendrix,Beth Childs,

1259
00:33:25,751 --> 00:33:27,884

1260
00:33:27,886 --> 00:33:30,787
Sarah Manning?

1261
00:33:30,789 --> 00:33:32,556
Anything else on her?

1262
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:35,492
No, nothing.

1263
00:33:35,494 --> 00:33:38,795
Listen, I have to go.She's coming. Bye.

1264
00:33:44,669 --> 00:33:47,904

Well, tell me more, love.

I mean, it can'tget any stranger

1274
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:39,609
than human cloning.

1275
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:42,679
Well, we live in Scarborough.

1276
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:44,047
About a million years ago,

1277
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:45,415
I went to university.

1278
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:48,151
You went to university?

1279
00:34:48,153 --> 00:34:49,453
Mm! Yes.Kinesiology.

1280
00:34:49,455 --> 00:34:51,254
Where'd you go wrong?

1281
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:54,791
Oh, that's just basicallymassage therapy, in't it?

1282
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:56,960
No, Sarah.

1283
00:34:56,962 --> 00:34:58,428
It's very important.

1284
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,097
It heals.

1285
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:01,098
Oh!

1286
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,432
No.

1287
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:05,001
Um, and then I got married.

1288
00:35:06,572 --> 00:35:09,005
And everything is shit.

1289
00:35:11,009 --> 00:35:12,642
She cameto see Kira once,

1290
00:35:12,644 --> 00:35:14,277
in your place, didn't she?

1291
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,215
I  knew  something was up.

1292
00:35:18,217 --> 00:35:21,485
Yeah, sorry, the crazy one,Helena, was after me.

1293
00:35:21,487 --> 00:35:24,955
Okay, so, Helena,Alison, Cosima.

1294
00:35:24,957 --> 00:35:27,224
Beth is the policewoman.

1295
00:35:27,226 --> 00:35:30,761
Yeah, who topped herself, yeah.

1296
00:35:30,763 --> 00:35:32,462
You.

1297
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:34,131
No, there's probablythousands of us.

1298
00:35:34,133 --> 00:35:36,399
Ahem! Unless Helena'skilled them all.

1299
00:35:36,401 --> 00:35:38,869
We're all messed up.

1300
00:35:38,871 --> 00:35:41,338
Except you, Sarah.

1301
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,807
I'm the biggest messthere is, Alison.

1302
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:46,243
No, no no no, becauseyou say "eff it".

1303
00:35:46,245 --> 00:35:48,512
I triedto say "eff it" today

1304
00:35:48,514 --> 00:35:51,047
and I blew up my whole life.

1305
00:35:51,049 --> 00:35:53,550
I just wantedto say "eff this",

1306
00:35:53,552 --> 00:35:56,019
"eff you", and I effed it,

1307
00:35:56,021 --> 00:35:57,420
I effed it all up.

1308
00:35:57,422 --> 00:35:58,421
Oh.

1309
00:35:58,423 --> 00:35:59,956
You know,would you like to see

1310
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:02,058
the guest bedroom,at this point, chicken?

1311
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:05,462
Huh? Huh?Come on.

1312
00:36:05,464 --> 00:36:08,265
Yes. Oh, you areso lovely.

1313
00:36:08,267 --> 00:36:11,802
Ahem! You know, you'revery lucky, Sarah.

1314
00:36:11,804 --> 00:36:13,737
My mother wouldn't bethis lovely. She...

1315
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:16,640
My mother would have meput in therapy.

1316
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,278
Yeah, yes.

1317
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,613
That's Sarah.

1318
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:26,016
Whew.

1319
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:28,351
I was just so shocked.

1320
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:30,220
Seeing her laid outon that slab,

1321
00:36:30,222 --> 00:36:31,388
looking so

1322
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:34,758
dead, really.

1323
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,627
So your foster sisterdidn't have any sisters?

1324
00:36:37,629 --> 00:36:40,764
Just me.

1325
00:36:40,766 --> 00:36:42,566
I keep asking myself

1326
00:36:42,568 --> 00:36:45,068
"What'd I miss?",you know?

1327
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,604
Because I never reallysaw the signs.

1328
00:36:47,606 --> 00:36:49,472
Beth Childs.

1329
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:50,841
Hmm?Who's that?

1330
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:55,045
You mind if I look?

1331
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:56,913
I like art.

1332
00:36:56,915 --> 00:37:00,350
No, yeah, by all means.

1333
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:07,324
Oh! Uh...

1334
00:37:07,326 --> 00:37:08,925
Those are

1335
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:09,993
the many sides of Sarah.

1336
00:37:09,995 --> 00:37:11,561
I call that series

1337
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:13,230
twisted sister.

1338
00:37:13,232 --> 00:37:14,397
I like 'em.

1339
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:15,799
Sort of working out your grief.

1340
00:37:15,801 --> 00:37:16,800
Yes.

1341
00:37:16,802 --> 00:37:19,436
Wherever it takes me.

1342
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,576
Thanks.

1343
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:27,978
I'm sorry, again,

1344
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,246
for your loss.

1345
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:31,681
Thank you.

1346
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:39,389
I've been here before.

1347
00:37:39,391 --> 00:37:41,858
What does that mean?

1348
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:53,136
Hello.

1349
00:37:53,138 --> 00:37:54,271

Last night, I get a phone call.

1354
00:38:04,182 --> 00:38:05,749
Some punk withan English accent

1355
00:38:05,751 --> 00:38:08,551
says he wantsto talk about Beth.

1356
00:38:08,553 --> 00:38:10,053
Then he hangs up.

1357
00:38:10,055 --> 00:38:12,331
Let's bring him in. Let'sshake his tree, man.

1358

Oh, and Dr. Leekiesends his regards.

1368
00:39:17,882 --> 00:39:19,753
between the lines.

1369
00:39:19,755 --> 00:39:21,688
What is it thatyou need, Sarah?

1370
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,323
How can I help?

1371
00:39:23,325 --> 00:39:24,858
Wow,

1372
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:28,362
Alison, Cosima, Beth...

1373
00:39:28,364 --> 00:39:29,997
Their mothers all wanted babies

1374
00:39:29,999 --> 00:39:31,431
enough to do in vitro.

1375
00:39:31,433 --> 00:39:34,401
So why did mine give me up?

1376
00:39:34,403 --> 00:39:35,602
There were

1377
00:39:35,604 --> 00:39:37,404
rumors.

1378
00:39:37,406 --> 00:39:40,073
Yeah?

1379
00:39:40,075 --> 00:39:41,742
That some of the kidswe were hiding,

1380
00:39:41,744 --> 00:39:44,444
the ones that camein Carlton's pipeline,

1381
00:39:44,446 --> 00:39:46,280
like you, childrenin the black...

1382
00:39:46,282 --> 00:39:47,681
What do you mean,

1383
00:39:47,683 --> 00:39:49,049
exactly, "in the black"?

1384
00:39:49,051 --> 00:39:50,417
You know, undocumented.

1385
00:39:50,419 --> 00:39:52,219
Outside the system.

1386
00:39:52,221 --> 00:39:53,720
The rumor was these kids

1387
00:39:53,722 --> 00:39:55,989
were the subject ofmedical experiments.

1388
00:39:59,227 --> 00:40:01,695
Carlton's pipeline.

1389
00:40:01,697 --> 00:40:03,196
What kind of experiments?

1390
00:40:03,198 --> 00:40:05,198
I don't know, love.

1391
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,700
It was a paranoid timeand a radical fringe.

1392
00:40:06,702 --> 00:40:08,702
Everything was rumor then.

1393
00:40:15,743 --> 00:40:17,244
Carlton brought me to you.

1394
00:40:17,246 --> 00:40:20,414
Wouldn't he knowwho my birth mother was?

1395
00:40:20,416 --> 00:40:22,382
He may. But,even if he did,

1396
00:40:22,384 --> 00:40:25,419
he might not tell  me.

1397
00:40:25,421 --> 00:40:26,787
Do your contactsstill know him?

1398
00:40:26,789 --> 00:40:29,402
It-it's possible.

1399
00:40:30,491 --> 00:40:31,758
Can you get in touch with him?

1400
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,126
It's 15 years ago.

1401
00:40:33,128 --> 00:40:35,996
Last I heard, he was inWormwood Scrubs Prison.

1402
00:40:35,998 --> 00:40:37,164
I'll try.

1403
00:41:16,237 --> 00:41:18,138
I just want to know who I am.

1404
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,374
You're still you.

1405
00:41:20,376 --> 00:41:23,977
Remember that.

1406
00:41:23,979 --> 00:41:26,113
You're a survivor.

1407
00:41:40,561 --> 00:41:41,561
Kira?

1408
00:41:45,867 --> 00:41:48,112
It's Helena!Kira!

1409
00:41:50,505 --> 00:41:52,139
Kira!

1410
00:41:54,542 --> 00:41:55,609
Kira!

1411
00:41:58,913 --> 00:42:02,149
Where are we going?

1412
00:42:02,151 --> 00:42:05,018
I'm taking you to meet someone.

1413
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:08,722
How can you be Sarah'sdaughter, child?

1414
00:42:08,724 --> 00:42:09,890
How can that be?

1415
00:42:09,892 --> 00:42:11,024
Kira!

1416
00:42:11,026 --> 00:42:12,025
Stop!

1417
00:42:12,027 --> 00:42:14,361
You're just like my mum.

1418
00:42:14,363 --> 00:42:15,729
No, I'm not.

1419
00:42:15,731 --> 00:42:17,898
She's not real.

1420
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:21,168
Of course she is.

1421
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:24,504
Kira!

1422
00:42:26,174 --> 00:42:29,242
Helena?

1423
00:42:29,244 --> 00:42:33,280
Yes, angel?

1424
00:42:33,282 --> 00:42:35,115
What happened to you?

1425
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:39,553
I don't know.

1426
00:42:52,633 --> 00:42:54,000
Kira!

1427
00:43:00,308 --> 00:43:01,475
Kira!

1428
00:43:01,477 --> 00:43:03,477
I should go home now.

1429
00:43:07,982 --> 00:43:09,950
Yes.

1430
00:43:09,952 --> 00:43:11,852
Do you know the way?

1431
00:43:11,854 --> 00:43:13,186
Of course.

1432
00:43:16,424 --> 00:43:19,726
Goodnight, angel.

1433
00:43:19,728 --> 00:43:20,727
Kira!

1434
00:43:20,729 --> 00:43:22,462
Mummy!

1435
00:43:23,799 --> 00:43:24,798
Kira, no!

1436
00:43:27,669 --> 00:43:30,570
No!

1437
00:43:35,309 --> 00:43:37,310
7-year-old femalestruck by vehicle.

1438
00:43:37,312 --> 00:43:39,579
GCS 3.Chest injury.

1439
00:43:39,581 --> 00:43:40,947
Possible internal bleeding.

1440
00:43:40,949 --> 00:43:42,415
- Stay with me, baby, please.- 3 minutes.

1441
00:43:42,417 --> 00:43:44,150
Bet you 100 bucks I know whoshe's going to look like

1442
00:43:44,152 --> 00:43:46,152
when Beckwith is donewith the reconstruction.

1443
00:43:46,154 --> 00:43:47,420
You got no chargethat'll stick, yet.

1444
00:43:47,422 --> 00:43:49,489
- Why is Sarah still alive?- Kill her!

1445
00:43:49,491 --> 00:43:51,691
Someone tampered withthe security footage

1446
00:43:51,693 --> 00:43:53,126
at Club Neolution

1447
00:43:53,128 --> 00:43:54,494
but I know

1448
00:43:54,496 --> 00:43:57,597
there were two clonesthere that night.

1449
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:59,065
Weren't there?

1450
00:43:59,067 --> 00:44:00,933
- Oh, my God!- Alison.

1451
00:44:00,935 --> 00:44:02,335
What is this?

1452
00:44:02,337 --> 00:44:03,770
We're gathered in the spirit

1453
00:44:03,772 --> 00:44:11,772
of love and understanding.
