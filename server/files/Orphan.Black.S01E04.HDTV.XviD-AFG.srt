기호학적으로 얘기하면

52
00:05:09,363 --> 00:05:12,166
오래 전에는 보편적으로다산을 뜻하는 거였지근데 이 날개들은
어쨌거나, 그게..

미안, 먄 먄 먄알았어 얘기가 샛네

56
00:05:20,668 --> 00:05:20,787

해답을 가지고있다고그 방법이
딱 하나 있지

61
00:05:33,056 --> 00:05:33,175
내가 다시 경찰로돌아가는거

62
00:05:33,924 --> 00:05:34,043
안돼

63
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,385
절대 안돼. 너 베스로돌아가서는 안된다고죽은 경찰관
사칭하는건

64
00:05:40,144 --> 00:05:42,294
그것도완전히 새로운 범죄거든솔직히 말하자면, 경찰들이랑
같이 있는게 제일 안전할꺼 같에

65
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,614
그게 정말 니 입으로할 소리야?

66
00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:46,617
저기, 아트가이미 살인범을 찾고 있어

67
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:49,960
베스인척 하면서눈을 가리는거지그애한테 무슨 일이 생긴건지
사람들이 찾게 두는거야

68
00:05:51,586 --> 00:05:52,970
그리고서그걸 알아내면내가 나서서
처리할 수 있을꺼야

69
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:53,915
"처리해"?

70
00:05:54,133 --> 00:05:56,259
나 이제 미친 놈의 유전자가이해되기 시작한다

71
00:05:56,378 --> 00:05:58,530
머, 그래,뇌내 나쁜 화학작용은

72
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,392
유전적일 수 있거든그래도 환경은..
그건 개인적이야, 그치?

73
00:06:04,568 --> 00:06:06,357
내 말은, 바로 그것이천성과 양육 환경에 대한
모든 궁금증이라는 거지

74
00:06:06,476 --> 00:06:08,723
좋아, 천성에 대해말하자면

75
00:06:08,922 --> 00:06:10,512

내 미친 누나는 제정신이지..비교하자면고맙다, 피

00:06:23,012 --> 00:06:25,672
내 생각엔이게 그애가 어디서 왔는지알아내는데 도움이 될꺼 같에
난 이쪽을 알아볼께

81
00:06:28,118 --> 00:06:29,724
아, 경찰 일이다

00:06:50,241 --> 00:06:50,859
그래, 애들 자고올꺼야

90
00:06:52,269 --> 00:06:54,415
그 대답이 아니잖아저기, 당신이 물어볼 처지가
아닐텐데, 그렇지, 도니?

91
00:06:54,476 --> 00:06:56,109
그래, 왜?

92
00:06:57,841 --> 00:07:00,184
왜 애들 일들을전부 취소한건데?내 자신을 위한 시간이
좀 필요하거든

93
00:07:00,303 --> 00:07:03,073
당신도 목요일 밤마다 고객들이랑정기적으로 술마시잖아, 그치?

94
00:07:03,781 --> 00:07:04,800
그래그럼 당신이

160
00:11:23,037 --> 00:11:23,099
그럼 다들 그 종이 접기의사본을 가지고 계시죠

161
00:11:24,895 --> 00:11:25,264
목격자 말로는우리가 틀렸었다고 합니다..

162
00:11:28,906 --> 00:11:28,974
피해자를 죽인건여성으로, 베스만한 몸집입니다

163
00:11:30,451 --> 00:11:32,397
그 피해자에 대해선쉽지가 않네요
두개골을 재구성하는데

164
00:11:34,505 --> 00:11:36,621
이게 자갈 부수는 기계를통과한 거라서.. 그래도사망 원인은
알아냈습니다

165
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,336
이 구멍은223구경입니다

166
00:11:39,455 --> 00:11:42,383
그럼, 원거리에,고성능 무기라는걸 알았으니

167
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:44,516
여성 저격범이 지목됐던

168
00:11:46,659 --> 00:11:46,778
살인사건 하나만말해보세요

169
00:11:47,964 --> 00:11:50,516
프로파일은 어떤가?여성 살인자들은 만성적으로
분리되어있는 경향이 있습니다

170
00:11:52,181 --> 00:11:55,185
고립은 인격장애를 낳죠여기 시편,
"이렇게 빚어진 것이 오묘하고 놀라워"

171
00:11:55,377 --> 00:11:57,193
종교적 환상을 가지고있어요

172
00:11:57,312 --> 00:11:59,594
막대 그림들이나인형 머리

173
00:12:00,771 --> 00:12:00,890
종이접기까지..

174
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:03,723
유아기 발달 과정 문제?학대를 심하게 당했다던가요

175
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:06,319
예, 하지만 매우 조심스럽죠자기 나름대론요

176
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:09,617
지금까진아무런 지문도 없어어요그럼 DNA 증거는?

177
00:12:11,044 --> 00:12:12,652
서두르고 있는데, 누군가 기록에일치하는게 있더라도아는데까지는
일주일은 걸릴꺼야

178
00:12:14,473 --> 00:12:16,050
피해자 지문도건진게 없나?손에선 일치하는게
안나왔어?

179
00:12:17,038 --> 00:12:19,315
아니, 아뇨, 없어요

180
00:12:20,396 --> 00:12:21,898
주목해봐요. 중요한건우리가 지금
매우 계획적이고

181
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:24,851
게임을 즐기는여성 살인범을 쫓고 있다는거죠

182
00:12:27,619 --> 00:12:28,411
이 종이접기처럼말이죠엔지

183
00:12:30,577 --> 00:12:30,632
특정한 선택은특정한 답을 보여줍니다

184
00:12:32,696 --> 00:12:34,949
선택한거에 따라다른 죽음이 있죠협박일 수도
기존의 살인일 수도있죠

185
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:37,577
거기 숫자들을조합해보면뭔가 의미가
있을 수도 있고요

186
00:12:38,504 --> 00:12:39,010
차일즈 씨?

187
00:12:39,905 --> 00:12:40,332
차일즈 씨

188
00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:45,785
전화에요

189
00:12:46,792 --> 00:12:48,495
차일즈 형삽니다아니, 너 아니지

190
00:12:48,719 --> 00:12:51,204
베스는 죽었어, 아닌가?

191
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:52,674
나한테 원하는게 뭐야?

192
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:55,276
날 죽일 수도 있었잖아근데 이렇게 있네

193
00:12:57,048 --> 00:12:57,523
넌 그런 느낌 없었어?

194
00:12:58,374 --> 00:12:58,493
뭐?

195
00:13:00,084 --> 00:13:01,897
우리가 이어져있다는거

196
00:13:03,304 --> 00:13:04,906
어, 그거 내가니 간에다철봉 꽂아준거 말이야?

197
00:13:05,964 --> 00:13:06,083
그건 좀 어때?

198
00:13:08,404 --> 00:13:08,523
내가 너 좀알아야겠거든

199
00:13:10,075 --> 00:13:10,693
다시 한번 만나지

200
00:13:13,047 --> 00:13:13,108
난 니 이름도 모르잖아

201
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:14,266
나도 너 이름 모르거든

202
00:13:15,993 --> 00:13:18,839
헬레나야

203
00:13:20,138 --> 00:13:22,443
성은 뭐야?니가 지금은
이 짓을 하고 있지만

204
00:13:22,562 --> 00:13:24,521
그게 얼마나 갈까..

205
00:13:26,956 --> 00:13:27,493
진짜 경찰이 날 찾으면?

206
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:32,386
넌 나야, 난 너고우리 둘다
피해자고 경찰이지

207
00:13:32,911 --> 00:13:35,015
그래, 우리 둘다한테안좋을 수도 있지

208
00:13:35,134 --> 00:13:38,068
그러니 나한테 와의논해보지

209
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:40,670
내가 벌써 위치는보내놨어

210
00:13:40,789 --> 00:13:42,785

그애 우리한테는이런 얘기 전혀 안했는데

381
00:26:54,057 --> 00:26:54,176
그래, 자기 파트너한테도전혀 얘기 안했더라

382
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:59,037
나 이짓 계속 못하겠어코지마헬레나가 왔었어
베스로 분장하고

우리 둘을 폭로시키겠데혼자오레오, 이런
안좋은 생각인데

00:27:16,317 --> 00:27:18,801
개인적이란거혼자 일하고,
아마 아이때 학대를 당했다는거

390
00:27:20,253 --> 00:27:20,372
좋아, 그래

전사가 아니란거야

396
00:27:34,304 --> 00:27:36,369
극도의창조론 지지자들에겐

397
00:27:38,127 --> 00:27:40,724
우리가협오스러워 보이겠지그게, 신의 자식이 아니면
그건, 사탄의 자식란 식이지

398
00:27:40,974 --> 00:27:44,433
그래서 우릴 싫어하고걘 우릴 죽이는거네

못 봤었잖니하지만 모든게 바껴서

487
00:34:25,055 --> 00:34:27,108

488
00:34:29,278 --> 00:34:30,587
아줌마우리 엄마 아니에요

489
00:34:38,613 --> 00:34:40,672
바보같긴

490
00:34:40,791 --> 00:34:42,436
당연히 내가 엄마잖니

491
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,363
내가 또 누구겠어?

492
00:34:49,392 --> 00:34:51,076
엄마랑 똑같이생긴거 뿐이에요

493
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:57,882
여전히 나란다키아라

494
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:00,071

00:35:01,341 --> 00:35:02,431
원숭이다른건요?

원숭이하고.. 음?

그건 베스가 아니에요저에요

502
00:35:23,126 --> 00:35:25,591
제 이름은사라 매닝이고..

503
00:35:26,036 --> 00:35:28,544
당신은 이 모든 일을밝혀내실 수 있다고

504
00:35:30,585 --> 00:35:33,475
제가 믿는거의 유일한 사람이에요

505
00:35:36,253 --> 00:35:36,446
키아라, 당장은 너희 엄마가여기 올 수가 없었어

506
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:51,630
왜요?

507
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:56,841
경찰이에요!안에 계세요!

508
00:35:58,994 --> 00:35:59,061
왜냐면 엄마는 바로 지금어딘가에서

00:36:01,178 --> 00:36:04,699
굉장히 용감한 일을하고 계시거든모두가 안심할 수 있도록
하고 계셔

510
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:25,035
그래야 둘이함께 있을 수 있잖니

511
00:36:26,572 --> 00:36:32,609
난 무기 없어

512
00:36:34,542 --> 00:36:35,636

넌 다른 것들이랑다르구나

518
00:36:54,097 --> 00:36:57,269

그래내가 지켜봐주지

522
00:37:15,085 --> 00:37:16,097
넌 어디서 왔지?

523
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:17,749
어디선가 튀어 나왔지

524
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:19,207
넌 어디서 왔어?

525
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:20,571
신이 보내셨지

526
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,237
올커니너도 모른단거네넌 신을 몰라

527
00:37:25,795 --> 00:37:26,083
이런 신?

528
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:28,718
니 친구 매기 첸에찍혀있던 낙인?

529
00:37:31,896 --> 00:37:34,811
매기는 널 만드는걸도왔었지

530
00:37:36,526 --> 00:37:36,894
그리곤 빛을 봤고

531
00:37:38,541 --> 00:37:39,497
그래서 우리 쪽으로온거야

532
00:37:41,595 --> 00:37:41,938
베스는 우릴 보호하려고그 여잘 죽인거네

그렇겠지우린 연결되 있으니까난 네 안에
빛을 볼 수 있어

535
00:37:49,885 --> 00:37:50,004
우리 전부는 안에하나의 빛이 있거든

536
00:37:51,154 --> 00:37:51,273
아니야!

537
00:37:52,825 --> 00:37:53,700
아... 아니야!

538
00:37:55,095 --> 00:37:57,760
다른 것들은인간의 신의 형상따른
조악한 복제품일 뿐이야

539
00:37:58,062 --> 00:37:59,544
넌 아니란거야?

540
00:38:00,049 --> 00:38:01,398
넌 특별해?

541
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,035
너한테 니가 원본이라고그랬군, 아니야?

542
00:38:20,985 --> 00:38:21,999
너희쪽 사람들!

543
00:38:22,173 --> 00:38:24,477
그들이 말한건사실이 아니야!

544
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,334
우린 유전적으로 동일해

545
00:38:27,748 --> 00:38:31,011
내가 널 구해줄께너, 나, 베스
니가 죽인 독일 애도!

546
00:38:32,363 --> 00:38:33,113
우린 전부 똑같이만들어 졌다고

547
00:38:34,689 --> 00:38:36,747
너보고 다르다고 했던게누구던지놈들이 우릴 미워하는 만큼
너도 미워하는거야

548
00:38:37,818 --> 00:38:41,471
니가 틀렸어

549
00:38:43,506 --> 00:38:47,777
무슨일이 있었던거야헬레나?

550
00:38:49,345 --> 00:38:56,211
물러서!

551
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:02,443
너 느껴지니?

552
00:39:03,858 --> 00:39:10,088
베스!

553
00:39:11,046 --> 00:39:13,078
베스!

554
00:39:14,049 --> 00:39:16,320
베스!

555
00:39:18,304 --> 00:39:23,258
베스너 안에 있어?

556
00:39:24,444 --> 00:39:28,815
도망가!

557
00:39:30,954 --> 00:39:43,208
느껴지지 않아?

558
00:39:45,681 --> 00:39:45,800
여기 아무도 없어요!너가 있지

559
00:39:46,894 --> 00:39:48,301
뭐야?

560
00:39:49,622 --> 00:39:50,290
베스!

561
00:39:52,405 --> 00:39:52,749
니가 죽인 여자의아파트에?

562
00:39:54,784 --> 00:39:59,513
젠장 너 정신이있는거야?

563
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:01,434
어떻게 앨리슨 고모가되는거에요?

564
00:40:03,517 --> 00:40:05,467
우리 엄마는자매가 하나도 없는데요우리 엄마는
엄마도 없어요

565
00:40:05,807 --> 00:40:08,437
그게, 많이 복잡하단다

566
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:11,883
그래도, 키아라너한텐 미안하지만

567
00:40:13,266 --> 00:40:16,276
그래도 니가비밀로 해주는게정말로 중요해
알았지?

568
00:40:17,226 --> 00:40:18,472
약속?

569
00:40:20,004 --> 00:40:21,800
자러가야겠다키아라 얘야

570
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:25,717
올라가자,잠옷 챙기고

571

새끼 손가락

00:40:30,141 --> 00:40:37,831
안녕, 엄마

573

전부 고마워요머, 네가 약속을 지켰잖니

575
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:46,453

애가 잘있잖아요그게, 어, 덕분에요

577
00:40:51,299 --> 00:40:52,678
사라

578
00:40:54,168 --> 00:40:55,657
내가 그냥, 어..

579
00:40:55,776 --> 00:40:58,560
내가 그냥 이 문제에 대해솔직히 말하는게 익숙하지 않아서

580
00:41:02,231 --> 00:41:04,778
음, 저 다시 오면좋겠어요

581
00:41:04,834 --> 00:41:06,418

반대하진 않을께그래도 천천히 하자꾸나

583
00:41:10,308 --> 00:41:11,810
그럼, 제가내일 들려서

584
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:14,400
학교에서 집까지같이 걸을께요

585
00:41:15,734 --> 00:41:16,559
바로 집으로요

586
00:41:18,024 --> 00:41:19,006
그렇다면야, 알았다

587
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:20,896
이런, 비둘기가 풀려났네

588
00:41:23,475 --> 00:41:23,737
바로 모퉁이에세계 평화가 올꺼야

589
00:41:25,696 --> 00:41:33,272
어여 꺼져버려

590
00:41:36,188 --> 00:41:37,064
머, 넌 놀랍지않나보네통과했잖아!

591
00:41:37,114 --> 00:41:39,384
너가 S 부인 머리를삼촌쪽으로 돌린거야, 음화!

592
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:41,449
머, 그런거지

593
00:41:42,908 --> 00:41:43,107
어-어

594
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:44,819
키아라가바로 알아보더라

595
00:41:46,374 --> 00:41:47,223
뭐

596
00:41:48,722 --> 00:41:55,682
이런, 젠장!

597
00:41:56,797 --> 00:41:58,510
내가 이해가안가거든나한텐 도대체 말도
안되는 일이야

598
00:41:58,899 --> 00:42:00,874
왜 자네가 매기 첸집에 갔는지

599
00:42:02,415 --> 00:42:02,595
설명이나 해봐

600
00:42:05,468 --> 00:42:05,880
말씀 드렸듯이요머리 좀 비우려고

601
00:42:07,901 --> 00:42:09,919
산책 좀 하다가요무심코 간거에요그냥 무심코 갔다고?
네

602
00:42:10,038 --> 00:42:12,352
"예"인가 "아니"인가..매기 첸 총격하고

603
00:42:15,249 --> 00:42:16,583
신원미상자 살인사건 사이에연결점이 있는건가?없어요

604
00:42:17,056 --> 00:42:18,685
저기, 니가 회의를요청했잖아, 베스

605
00:42:18,804 --> 00:42:20,320
그럼 우리가여기서 뭐하는거야?

606
00:42:21,448 --> 00:42:24,703
첸 사건 이후에 전,제 자신이할 수 있다는걸 보여주려고 돌아왔어요

607
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:27,894
근데 누구한테도 뭐하나도잘 못하고 있죠. 그래서..

608
00:42:29,207 --> 00:42:30,830
빠질께요

609
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:34,168
우리가 너한테그렇게나 전부 해줬는데도?

610
00:42:35,582 --> 00:42:38,004
예, 그 점 감사드려요그래도..근데 나가겠다
왜지?

611
00:42:38,265 --> 00:42:40,369
너 뭔가 있는거야?!

612
00:42:40,737 --> 00:42:43,176
빠져나가는건해답이 아니네, 차일즈

613
00:42:43,514 --> 00:42:45,044
이러면 어떻게 되죠?

614
00:42:48,188 --> 00:42:50,022
이런거 말입니다?

615
00:00:04,851 --> 00:00:06,350
I saw a girl kill herself.

616
00:00:06,366 --> 00:00:08,196
And she looked exactly like me.

617
00:00:08,204 --> 00:00:10,378
Elizabeth Childs. To find out who she is

618
00:00:10,394 --> 00:00:11,636
or to rob the rest of her shit?

619
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:13,709
Beth is a cop. I'm a cop.

620
00:00:13,728 --> 00:00:15,294
Who the hell is Maggie Chen?

621
00:00:15,296 --> 00:00:16,868
That's the woman Beth shot.

622
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:19,273
The only way you willregain custody of Kira

623
00:00:22,435 --> 00:00:22,437
- is to show me you can be still.- We're clones.

624
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:24,651
We're someone's experimentand they're killing us off!

625
00:00:25,863 --> 00:00:25,907
The German's dead.

626
00:00:27,717 --> 00:00:27,740
Someone shot her right in front of me!

627
00:00:29,524 --> 00:00:29,644
You need to get rid of the body.

628
00:00:31,104 --> 00:00:31,224
Beth's partner found the German...

629
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:32,238
or at least part of her.

630
00:00:34,232 --> 00:00:34,248
If the body matches me, the cops will see

631
00:00:36,234 --> 00:00:38,584
a mugshot of somebody who looks like Beth,only it's yours truly and I'm
already supposed to be dead.

632
00:00:38,586 --> 00:00:40,441
Beth had a substantial sum,

633
00:00:41,677 --> 00:00:41,700
a fund she used to buy

634
00:00:43,038 --> 00:00:44,844
information we couldn't get officially.The fund was how I could contribute.

635
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:46,486
The killer contacted Art.

636
00:00:46,501 --> 00:00:48,308
He's already at the scenewhere Katja was shot.

637
00:00:48,336 --> 00:00:49,884
That was in the sniper's nest.

638
00:00:50,004 --> 00:00:52,508
We got a live one. Phonecalls, leaving clues.

639
00:00:52,628 --> 00:00:54,729
"I am fearfully and wonderfully made."

640
00:00:55,943 --> 00:00:57,476
I'm okay! Go after him, go!

641
00:00:57,478 --> 00:00:58,677
Oh!

642
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:00,146
I'm not Beth!

643
00:01:16,596 --> 00:01:18,164
"I'm not Beth".

644
00:01:26,573 --> 00:01:28,440
"I'm not Beth".

645
00:01:36,249 --> 00:01:38,484
"I'm not Beth".

646
00:01:38,486 --> 00:01:41,020
"I'm not Beth".

647
00:02:30,403 --> 00:02:32,504
Shh.

648
00:03:37,144 --> 00:03:38,806
Why would one of us be killing us?

649
00:03:39,976 --> 00:03:42,472
What is wrong with her?Bad breath. Batshit crazy.

650
00:03:42,476 --> 00:03:45,079
Does she know about me, about my kids?

651
00:03:46,057 --> 00:03:47,346
How do you know you didn't justbring her right to my doorstep?

652
00:03:47,384 --> 00:03:49,982
Because she's impaled withrebar and I wouldn't do that.

653
00:03:49,984 --> 00:03:51,300
I have been living this nightmare

654
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:52,764
much longer than you have, Sarah.

655
00:03:52,776 --> 00:03:54,766
I explained I have a family to protect.

656
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:55,961
I do what I can.

657
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:58,626
Right, you provide financially.

658
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,849
Yeah, so you wanted thatmoney Beth was holding.

659
00:04:01,918 --> 00:04:03,557
Your self defense fund.

660
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,291
You're right, I was going to steal it

661
00:04:06,323 --> 00:04:08,819
and run, but I can't do that,

662
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:10,583
because I have a family, too, Alison,

663
00:04:10,703 --> 00:04:11,784
my daughter.

664
00:04:12,804 --> 00:04:13,973
Your daughter?

665
00:04:14,243 --> 00:04:15,808
Yeah. Her name's Kira

666
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,403
and I'm meant to be seeing her today,

667
00:04:17,421 --> 00:04:20,094
but there's this killer up my arse, so.

668
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:22,325
Wait, is she your biological child

669
00:04:22,344 --> 00:04:23,839
or adopted, like mine?

670
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:25,951
Mine. Why?

671
00:04:27,124 --> 00:04:30,122
Don't you think you should'vetold us about that before?

672
00:04:30,124 --> 00:04:31,623
Why would I do that?

673
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,007
I'm telling you now because we have to

674
00:04:33,024 --> 00:04:34,644
deal with this, yeah?

675
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:36,953
Beth was on this killer'shit list and, now, I am.

676
00:04:36,997 --> 00:04:39,524
Yeah? What am I supposed to do about it?

677
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,237
How can I help?

678
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:47,072
Be available.

679
00:04:47,713 --> 00:04:49,991
I may need you, somehow.

680
00:04:56,466 --> 00:04:59,000
Wow, rich, man.

681
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:00,915
This looks like a new blade inset

682
00:05:00,921 --> 00:05:02,911
in a much older handle,

683
00:05:02,923 --> 00:05:06,183
so the fish is a bitch,semiotically speaking,

684
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:09,361
like a universal waybacksymbol of fecundity.

685
00:05:09,363 --> 00:05:12,164
But these wings, though, they're...

686
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,160
Seriously, what is she on about?

687
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,999
Quiet. She's just weird.

688
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:17,485
Sorry. Sorry sorry sorry.

689
00:05:17,532 --> 00:05:19,190
Okay, going on a tangent there.

690
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,667
If she's not dead,

691
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:23,208
we need to find her,find out what she knows.

692
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,540
Are you mad?

693
00:05:25,947 --> 00:05:25,960
She's a homicidal maniac.

694
00:05:27,862 --> 00:05:27,893
Yeah, but we need to findout who she is, Sarah.

695
00:05:29,388 --> 00:05:29,413
She's... she's she found us.

696
00:05:30,348 --> 00:05:30,383
She's got answers.

697
00:05:31,634 --> 00:05:31,647
The only way I'm going to do that is

698
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,175
go back to being a cop.

699
00:05:33,923 --> 00:05:34,043
No.

700
00:05:36,438 --> 00:05:36,440
No way. You're notgoing back to being Beth.

701
00:05:38,385 --> 00:05:40,142
Impersonating a dead officer,that's like a whole new crime.

702
00:05:40,144 --> 00:05:42,293
I think I'm safest with thecops, to be honest with you.

703
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,613
Did that actually justcome out of your mouth?

704
00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:46,615
Look, Art's already looking for the killer.

705
00:05:46,617 --> 00:05:48,108
I shadow him as Beth,

706
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:49,941
I let them figure outwhat's happened to her,

707
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,574
and then, when I find that out,

708
00:05:51,586 --> 00:05:52,969
I can jump off and deal.

709
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:53,914
"Deal"?

710
00:05:54,133 --> 00:05:56,258
I'm beginning to realize crazy's genetic.

711
00:05:56,378 --> 00:05:58,505
Well, yeah, bad brain chemistry

712
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,094
can be genetic,

713
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,348
but environment...that's individual, right?

714
00:06:03,392 --> 00:06:04,549
I mean, that's the whole

715
00:06:04,568 --> 00:06:06,356
nature/nurture question right there.

716
00:06:06,476 --> 00:06:08,722
Okay, let's talk nature.

717
00:06:08,922 --> 00:06:10,468
Out of 9, so far,

718
00:06:10,512 --> 00:06:12,508
one's a psycho who killed 4 others,

719
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:13,865
one committed suicide,

720
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:15,744
one is a bloody soccer mum,

721
00:06:17,482 --> 00:06:17,602
and then, there's you.

722
00:06:19,853 --> 00:06:19,897
My crazy sister is sane, by comparison.

723
00:06:21,161 --> 00:06:21,204
Thanks, Fe.

724
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:23,012
I think this might help us figure out

725
00:06:25,672 --> 00:06:28,118
where she's coming from,so I'll look into it.

726
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:30,195
Ah, police business.

727
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:32,548
- Art's got a lead.- Okay.

728
00:06:34,217 --> 00:06:34,237
Hey, you didn't show this to Alison,

729
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:35,550
by any chance, did you?

730
00:06:37,621 --> 00:06:39,318
Are you joking? She'd crap her lululemons.

731
00:06:40,931 --> 00:06:44,053
I've got Alison on standby.

732
00:06:45,898 --> 00:06:46,018
Make sure Gemma wears her seatbelt!

733
00:06:47,293 --> 00:06:48,457
You're sending the kids to your parentson a school morning.

734
00:06:48,507 --> 00:06:50,240
Well, they're staying the night.

735
00:06:50,859 --> 00:06:52,267
That's not an answer.

736
00:06:52,269 --> 00:06:54,414
Well, you didn't pose it asa question, did you, Donnie?

737
00:06:54,476 --> 00:06:56,109
Okay. Why?

738
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:57,841
Why did you cancel all their activities?

739
00:07:00,183 --> 00:07:00,303
I just wanted some time to myself.

740
00:07:03,073 --> 00:07:03,779
You have your usual Thursday-nightdrinks with clients, right?Yes.

741
00:07:03,781 --> 00:07:04,799
So I'll see you when you come

742
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,671
crashing in at 3:00 am, normal time.

743
00:07:07,685 --> 00:07:09,536
I don't crash in.

744
00:07:09,549 --> 00:07:10,794
One time.

745
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:30,839
Oh, crap.

746
00:07:32,275 --> 00:07:33,943
Sorry.

747
00:07:34,278 --> 00:07:35,664
I'm jumpy, too.

748
00:07:36,427 --> 00:07:37,813
How's your head?

749
00:07:37,815 --> 00:07:39,393
Probably about the same as yours.

750
00:07:40,137 --> 00:07:42,462
It's a good day to be alive, Beth.

751
00:07:42,464 --> 00:07:43,712
My kids thank you.

752
00:07:43,832 --> 00:07:45,499
Hell, even my ex thanks you.

753
00:07:45,512 --> 00:07:46,482
Yeah, don't mention it.

754
00:07:46,544 --> 00:07:48,221
I didn't. They did it.

755
00:07:48,404 --> 00:07:50,011
I got a present for you.

756
00:07:50,298 --> 00:07:52,039
Our killer made a pit-stop.

757
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,445
That's his bike.

758
00:07:53,876 --> 00:07:54,959
They got him?

759
00:07:56,573 --> 00:07:57,624
No, but we got a witness.

760
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:03,348
Just follow the bloody brick road.

761
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:06,070
Hey, there he is, our walking wounded.

762
00:08:06,896 --> 00:08:06,921
You all good, Art?

763
00:08:09,211 --> 00:08:09,236
- Yeah.- Yeah? Hey, glad you're okay.

764
00:08:11,088 --> 00:08:12,846
We're going to get thisguy. Don't worry, all right?So your guy wore gloves. No prints.

765
00:08:12,865 --> 00:08:14,360
But he's not exactly covering his tracks.

766
00:08:14,385 --> 00:08:15,562
Go take a look.

767
00:08:23,664 --> 00:08:25,120
Self-surgery.

768
00:08:25,829 --> 00:08:28,375
Guy's what, military?

769
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,027
Looks like it's gotta hurt.

770
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:31,616
Oh, the witness is ready.

771
00:08:32,129 --> 00:08:33,613
Art, you want to take him?

772
00:08:33,615 --> 00:08:34,638
No.

773
00:08:35,551 --> 00:08:36,465
Come on.

774
00:08:38,586 --> 00:08:40,120
I slept through the whole thing.

775
00:08:40,731 --> 00:08:42,689
I can't believe it.

776
00:08:42,896 --> 00:08:44,416
Trevor came into my room.

777
00:08:44,426 --> 00:08:45,749
It was dark

778
00:08:46,261 --> 00:08:47,832
and he was all wet

779
00:08:48,931 --> 00:08:50,163
with blood.

780
00:08:55,147 --> 00:08:57,724
He said it was an angry angel.

781
00:09:03,699 --> 00:09:04,856
Hey, Trevor.

782
00:09:05,157 --> 00:09:07,960
Can you tell me what theangry angel looked like?

783
00:09:16,457 --> 00:09:19,435
The person in your bathroom was a woman?

784
00:09:20,386 --> 00:09:22,000
Is that possible?

785
00:09:26,755 --> 00:09:28,238
Let me talk to him.

786
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,103
Yeah, sure.

787
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:36,894
It's okay, darling.

788
00:09:37,232 --> 00:09:38,658
I'm not her.

789
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,223
She said you would come.

790
00:09:43,119 --> 00:09:44,751
Pick a color.

791
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:47,762
Red.

792
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:55,062
That one.

793
00:09:56,119 --> 00:09:58,131
Wait wait wait. Let me see that.

794
00:10:02,726 --> 00:10:04,530
- Can I keep this?- Yes.

795
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,351
What you got there?

796
00:10:07,859 --> 00:10:09,176
Souvenir.

797
00:10:14,182 --> 00:10:15,861
What the hell?

798
00:10:16,469 --> 00:10:17,851
Hey, can you bag this?

799
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:28,328
It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.

800
00:10:34,956 --> 00:10:39,097
Yes, once again, 8:00, before her bedtime.

801
00:10:39,341 --> 00:10:40,841
Is that my mum?

802
00:10:40,856 --> 00:10:41,908
No, hon.

803
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,743
Did you just tell her it wasn't me?

804
00:10:43,745 --> 00:10:45,461
Sarah, why are you calling?

805
00:10:45,581 --> 00:10:48,045
If you don't show, after allthis anticipation, I will...

806
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,616
Just making sure we're still on.

807
00:10:49,618 --> 00:10:51,273
Well, we are, at this end.

808
00:10:51,336 --> 00:10:53,186
Yeah, I'll be there.

809
00:10:53,838 --> 00:10:55,288
Can I talk to her?

810
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,857
You can talk to her tonight.

811
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:01,995
If you let her down,

812
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:05,298
that's it, I won't let you see her again.

813
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:08,140
I said I'll be there.

814
00:11:20,941 --> 00:11:23,036
So you all have copiesof the fortune teller.

815
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,894
Eyewitness says we got it wrong...

816
00:11:25,264 --> 00:11:28,905
Jane Doe's killer isfemale, about Beth's size.

817
00:11:28,974 --> 00:11:30,413
As for the Jane Doe,

818
00:11:30,451 --> 00:11:32,366
it isn't easy, reconstructing a skull

819
00:11:32,397 --> 00:11:34,468
that's gone through a gravel crusher, but,

820
00:11:34,505 --> 00:11:36,620
we do have cause of death.

821
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,335
This hole, .223-caliber.

822
00:11:39,455 --> 00:11:42,382
So, we have a long-range,high-powered weapon.

823
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:44,485
Name me one homicide

824
00:11:44,516 --> 00:11:46,658
ever pinned on a female sniper.

825
00:11:46,778 --> 00:11:47,958
How's that profile?

826
00:11:47,964 --> 00:11:50,495
Female killers tend to sufferfrom chronic detachment.

827
00:11:50,516 --> 00:11:52,149
Isolation breeds sociopaths.

828
00:11:52,181 --> 00:11:55,184
This psalm, "fearfullyand wonderfully made"...

829
00:11:55,377 --> 00:11:57,192
she's a religious fanatic.

830
00:11:57,312 --> 00:11:59,576
The stick figures, the doll's head,

831
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:00,770
the fortune teller...

832
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,585
early-childhood development issues?

833
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:03,692
Could be extreme abuse.

834
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,257
Yes, but he's also careful, in her way.

835
00:12:06,319 --> 00:12:08,422
No prints on any of this, so far.

836
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:09,605
And the DNA evidence?

837
00:12:09,617 --> 00:12:11,019
On rush, but we're still a week away

838
00:12:11,044 --> 00:12:12,651
from knowing if they match anyone on file.

839
00:12:12,652 --> 00:12:14,473
Nothing on Jane Doe's prints?

840
00:12:16,049 --> 00:12:17,038
Her hand didn't give us a match?

841
00:12:19,315 --> 00:12:20,372
No. No, they did not.Look, the bottom line is

842
00:12:20,396 --> 00:12:21,880
we are chasing a calculated

843
00:12:21,898 --> 00:12:23,951
female killer who loves playing games.

844
00:12:24,851 --> 00:12:27,617
Like these fortune tellers.

845
00:12:27,619 --> 00:12:28,386
Angie.

846
00:12:28,411 --> 00:12:30,576
Certain choices give certain answers.

847
00:12:30,632 --> 00:12:32,653
Every choice is a different death.

848
00:12:32,696 --> 00:12:34,936
Could be threats, could be existing kills.

849
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:36,144
They might mean something,

850
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:37,546
when combined with the numbers.

851
00:12:37,577 --> 00:12:38,503
Childs?

852
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:39,904
Childs.

853
00:12:40,332 --> 00:12:41,698
Call for you.

854
00:12:45,785 --> 00:12:46,786
Detective Childs.

855
00:12:46,792 --> 00:12:48,494
No, you're not.

856
00:12:48,719 --> 00:12:51,204
Beth is dead, isn't she?

857
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:52,674
What do you want from me?

858
00:12:54,889 --> 00:12:55,276
You could've killed me, but here we are.

859
00:12:57,047 --> 00:12:57,523
You didn't feel it?

860
00:12:58,373 --> 00:12:58,493
What?

861
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,897
We have a connection.

862
00:13:03,292 --> 00:13:03,304
Uh, you mean when I stuck

863
00:13:04,856 --> 00:13:04,906
that piece of rebar in your liver?

864
00:13:05,963 --> 00:13:06,083
How's that going?

865
00:13:08,403 --> 00:13:08,523
I need to know who you are.

866
00:13:10,074 --> 00:13:10,693
Let's meet again.

867
00:13:13,046 --> 00:13:13,108
I never got your name.

868
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:14,266
I never got yours.

869
00:13:15,992 --> 00:13:19,036
Helena.

870
00:13:20,136 --> 00:13:20,138
And last name?

871
00:13:22,442 --> 00:13:22,562
You're doing all this work,

872
00:13:24,502 --> 00:13:24,521
but how long can that last,

873
00:13:26,955 --> 00:13:27,493
when the real police find me?

874
00:13:29,145 --> 00:13:29,170
You are me, I'm you,

875
00:13:32,385 --> 00:13:32,911
we're both the victim and the cop.

876
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:35,134
Yeah, that would be bad for both of us.

877
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:38,736
So come see me, discuss.

878
00:13:40,669 --> 00:13:40,789
I already gave you directions.

879
00:13:42,784 --> 00:13:43,766
Hey, c'mere.

880
00:13:46,162 --> 00:13:48,972
The numbers, they're addresses.

881
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:53,276
Okay, 17 is the street number of the quarrywhere we found Jane Doe.

882
00:13:53,301 --> 00:13:55,347
Yeah. Rooming house,

883
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:57,881
shooting scene,

884
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,726
the kid's house,

885
00:13:59,914 --> 00:14:01,397
even the precinct...

886
00:14:01,459 --> 00:14:02,422
everywhere we've been.

887
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:05,513
Except one... 1024. GPS gives one address

888
00:14:06,495 --> 00:14:06,551
with that street number,

889
00:14:08,622 --> 00:14:08,634
10 minutes from the kid'shouse, Lakepoint Road.

890
00:14:10,405 --> 00:14:10,643
No, I know that place.

891
00:14:12,281 --> 00:14:12,401
A lot of squatters around there.

892
00:14:13,927 --> 00:14:13,977
- Let's check it out.- Hold it.

893
00:14:16,148 --> 00:14:16,173
Wait for emergency tactical, huh?

894
00:14:17,331 --> 00:14:17,350
This is a probable sniper,

895
00:14:19,408 --> 00:14:19,427
so let them sweep it,first, before you go in.

896
00:14:21,448 --> 00:14:21,568
- Got it?- Yeah.

897
00:14:24,995 --> 00:14:33,987
Hey, don't worry. Let's do this.

898
00:14:35,594 --> 00:14:35,645
I'm parked over here, so.

899
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:40,005
No no no no no. After last night,we stick together. Come on.

900
00:15:07,065 --> 00:15:08,391
Whoa, Beth!

901
00:15:08,511 --> 00:15:09,913
Rough night?

902
00:15:11,957 --> 00:15:13,883
Okeydoke, then.

903
00:15:25,446 --> 00:15:26,429
Out.

904
00:15:57,728 --> 00:15:58,511
What?

905
00:15:58,631 --> 00:16:00,895
Anybody else feel like theyhave a target on their back?

906
00:16:02,121 --> 00:16:04,581
- All clear.- Copy. Okay,

907
00:16:04,903 --> 00:16:06,651
I'll take you guys in for a closer look.

908
00:16:06,771 --> 00:16:08,347
You're going to love it.

909
00:16:41,136 --> 00:16:43,640
Over here, detectives.

910
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:51,447
Looks like more self-surgery.

911
00:16:54,964 --> 00:16:57,297
Can't be long 'til she bleeds out.

912
00:17:00,024 --> 00:17:02,196
Ho-ly shit.

913
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,937
It's the same figuresas the fortune teller.

914
00:17:06,582 --> 00:17:08,478
She saying she's a serial killer?

915
00:17:08,598 --> 00:17:10,436
Could be her single victim,

916
00:17:10,468 --> 00:17:13,653
our Jane Doe, over and over again.

917
00:17:13,997 --> 00:17:16,030
Or she just draws like a third-grader.

918
00:17:16,831 --> 00:17:18,408
This her?

919
00:17:20,148 --> 00:17:21,849
Or her next victim?

920
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,502
Next victim.

921
00:18:25,514 --> 00:18:27,058
Detective Childs.

922
00:18:27,178 --> 00:18:28,617
Hey, it's me.

923
00:18:29,655 --> 00:18:31,301
- Paul?- Oh.

924
00:18:32,021 --> 00:18:33,303
Hello, Paul.

925
00:18:33,353 --> 00:18:34,655
How are you doing?

926
00:18:34,775 --> 00:18:38,759
- Mm, not too good. I got beat up.- What?!

927
00:18:38,879 --> 00:18:39,635
What happened?

928
00:18:39,755 --> 00:18:41,744
Oh, please come get me outta here.

929
00:18:45,816 --> 00:18:47,812
She led us here.

930
00:18:48,056 --> 00:18:49,732
She wanted us to see this.

931
00:18:49,734 --> 00:18:51,140
May be a wild goose chase,

932
00:18:51,153 --> 00:18:52,651
- wasting our time.- No.

933
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,871
She had a reason.

934
00:18:55,106 --> 00:18:56,864
Okay, let's let forensics have this.

935
00:18:57,559 --> 00:18:59,460
I hope you don't have dinner plans.

936
00:19:00,311 --> 00:19:02,111
Yeah, I'll be right with you.

937
00:19:08,052 --> 00:19:09,434
Is it my imagination,

938
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,134
or does Cosima havebigger breasts than you?

939
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,305
There's no way I can makedinner with Kira tonight.

940
00:19:13,324 --> 00:19:14,506
Well, you've got to.

941
00:19:14,626 --> 00:19:16,508
I can't. I'm stuck with Art

942
00:19:16,628 --> 00:19:18,429
and this bitch is right on top of me.

943
00:19:19,924 --> 00:19:20,044
I could lead her straight to Kira.

944
00:19:22,571 --> 00:19:22,577
I know, but Mrs S gave you an ultimatum.

945
00:19:23,691 --> 00:19:23,902
She's going to cut you off.

946
00:19:25,292 --> 00:19:27,436
Rock and a hard place, here, Fe.Yeah, your permanent address.

947
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:30,391
I do have one really idiotic idea.

948
00:19:30,454 --> 00:19:32,055
Oh, good.

949
00:19:32,277 --> 00:19:34,258
I need to be in two places at once, yeah?

950
00:19:34,295 --> 00:19:35,244
Yeah.

951
00:19:35,364 --> 00:19:37,955
Well, if anybody can do that, we can.

952
00:19:38,075 --> 00:19:40,416
Are you effing serious?!

953
00:19:40,883 --> 00:19:42,952
Yeah, suddenly, I am.

954
00:20:18,155 --> 00:20:19,836
What happened? Is she okay?

955
00:20:19,867 --> 00:20:21,500
Yeah, she's okay. She's fine.

956
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,693
That doesn't sound okay.

957
00:20:23,695 --> 00:20:25,473
Sarah needs your help with her daughter.

958
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,251
I'll get the drawings outto my criminal-psych guy.

959
00:20:33,371 --> 00:20:35,102
Where's missing persons on our Jane Doe?

960
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:36,003
Nothing local.

961
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,236
Well, widen the net.

962
00:20:37,356 --> 00:20:38,662
How wide?

963
00:20:38,725 --> 00:20:40,113
North America.

964
00:20:41,014 --> 00:20:42,766
Whoa, quick change.

965
00:20:44,155 --> 00:20:44,950
Huh?

966
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,189
Your whole look,

967
00:20:46,309 --> 00:20:47,665
it's cleaned right up.

968
00:20:48,904 --> 00:20:50,030
Looks way better.

969
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:51,807
Keep it in your pants, Raj.

970
00:20:53,296 --> 00:20:55,110
Uh, sorry.

971
00:20:55,285 --> 00:20:56,430
Guys,

972
00:20:56,794 --> 00:20:58,227
what the hell?

973
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,329
Nice to know someone's having fun.

974
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,193
Maggie Chen?

975
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,547
I'm sorry, but she wants me

976
00:21:58,249 --> 00:21:59,776
to impersonate her,in front of her own daughter,

977
00:21:59,798 --> 00:22:01,300
who she hasn't seen in almost a year?

978
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,557
10 months.

979
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,622
This is terrible parenting, Felix.

980
00:22:06,136 --> 00:22:06,161
I mean, that poor child.

981
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:08,907
I don't think you understandthe situation here.

982
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:10,541
If Sarah misses tonight,

983
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:12,268
then she may never get Kira back.

984
00:22:14,402 --> 00:22:14,946
I'm sorry, but a request like this?

985
00:22:16,472 --> 00:22:16,516
Maybe the child is better off

986
00:22:17,129 --> 00:22:17,161
with your foster mother.

987
00:22:18,706 --> 00:22:19,069
Excuse me?

988
00:22:21,571 --> 00:22:21,603
Sarah is out there, risking her life,

989
00:22:23,436 --> 00:22:23,498
playing cat-and-mousewith killer clone,

990
00:22:25,323 --> 00:22:27,730
so that your kids don't end up orphans,and you think that she should
lose her child for that?

991
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,596
Yeah.

992
00:22:30,665 --> 00:22:32,710
I think you need to step up, here, sister.

993
00:22:36,202 --> 00:22:37,553
Well, I did just play Annelle

994
00:22:37,584 --> 00:22:38,817
in "Steel Magnolias".

995
00:22:38,992 --> 00:22:39,968
Seriously?

996
00:22:40,088 --> 00:22:42,896
Mm-hmm. Glendale community theatre.

997
00:22:43,547 --> 00:22:46,237
Annelle, Annelle... oh, my God!

998
00:22:46,481 --> 00:22:47,907
The Daryl Hannah part?

999
00:22:48,089 --> 00:22:49,034
Yeah.

1000
00:22:49,672 --> 00:22:51,191
Terrible casting.

1001
00:22:51,223 --> 00:22:54,088
It was actually very good acting, Felix.

1002
00:22:54,426 --> 00:22:55,646
Trust me, Sarah's no stretch.

1003
00:22:55,686 --> 00:22:56,872
I got great reviews.

1004
00:22:56,928 --> 00:22:58,718
From the whole neighborhood, I'm sure.

1005
00:22:58,838 --> 00:23:00,457
Ahem.

1006
00:23:01,408 --> 00:23:03,291
The rain in Spain

1007
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,926
falls mainly on the plain.

1008
00:23:06,046 --> 00:23:08,979
Okay, Eliza. Holy shit.

1009
00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:12,471
We need to pull a fullreverse "Pygmalion" here.

1010
00:23:35,358 --> 00:23:36,865
My crime-psych guy says

1011
00:23:36,927 --> 00:23:38,530
biblically messed up or not,

1012
00:23:38,573 --> 00:23:40,356
woman-on-woman meansits got to be personal,

1013
00:23:42,227 --> 00:23:42,902
whether it's her first or 15th kill.

1014
00:23:44,116 --> 00:23:44,172
Yeah, no, that makes sense.

1015
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,520
So we're back to Jane Doeand who she was to Jane death.

1016
00:23:47,914 --> 00:23:49,679
Something's gotta give.

1017
00:23:50,048 --> 00:23:51,787
When it does, you know?

1018
00:23:52,237 --> 00:23:55,015
Yeah. Right behind ya.

1019
00:23:55,084 --> 00:23:56,417
Ahem.

1020
00:23:58,316 --> 00:24:00,395
These are your worst clothes?

1021
00:24:00,751 --> 00:24:02,047
Well, I'm sorry, mate,

1022
00:24:02,084 --> 00:24:03,442
but I don't shop secondhand.

1023
00:24:03,562 --> 00:24:06,914
No, no, my God, no. It's not "mate",

1024
00:24:06,965 --> 00:24:08,679
all right? It's more like, um,

1025
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,343
it's like "might".

1026
00:24:10,463 --> 00:24:11,463
- "Might".- Yeah.

1027
00:24:11,501 --> 00:24:13,040
'Ello, "might".

1028
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:17,100
Yeah, that's better. But,

1029
00:24:17,157 --> 00:24:19,465
look, you're going tohave to get past Mrs S,

1030
00:24:19,497 --> 00:24:22,537
so you really got to play thedreary history there, you know?

1031
00:24:22,606 --> 00:24:24,045
I mean, you basically won't talk.

1032
00:24:24,076 --> 00:24:25,904
This shirt is all wrong.

1033
00:24:26,448 --> 00:24:27,824
Hey! Hey hey!

1034
00:24:28,037 --> 00:24:30,634
Not "hey"! You're a punk.

1035
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:31,842
Be one.

1036
00:24:32,483 --> 00:24:33,916
Oi!

1037
00:24:45,707 --> 00:24:46,958
Detective Childs.

1038
00:24:47,008 --> 00:24:49,360
There's a visitor for you.

1039
00:24:55,178 --> 00:24:56,636
Hey hey hey. What are you doing here?

1040
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,376
You said come get you.

1041
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:00,134
What happened? Are you okay?

1042
00:25:00,511 --> 00:25:04,170
Yeah. Yeah, no, I'm fine. Really.

1043
00:25:04,201 --> 00:25:06,290
You didn't sound fine and you don't

1044
00:25:06,353 --> 00:25:07,373
look fine.

1045
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:09,632
Come on, I took the rest of the day off.

1046
00:25:11,184 --> 00:25:11,190
Whatever you need, okay?

1047
00:25:14,843 --> 00:25:14,963
- No no no. No. Paul, I can't!- Paul!

1048
00:25:16,063 --> 00:25:16,101
Everything all right here?

1049
00:25:18,234 --> 00:25:19,498
Does she seem all right to you?!

1050
00:25:20,824 --> 00:25:20,887
Okay. Take it easy.

1051
00:25:22,852 --> 00:25:22,889
First day back, she gets beat up?

1052
00:25:24,541 --> 00:25:24,604
No wonder she wants to leave.

1053
00:25:25,755 --> 00:25:29,171
Boy, what the hell are you talking about?No no no no. Paul, please. Art? I got this.

1054
00:25:30,735 --> 00:25:32,174
Do you?

1055
00:25:34,439 --> 00:25:35,885
What am I doing here?

1056
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:38,131
Sorry, I overreacted.

1057
00:25:38,343 --> 00:25:40,896
I didn't mean literally"come get me this second".

1058
00:25:41,109 --> 00:25:42,329
Then what did you mean?

1059
00:25:42,449 --> 00:25:43,724
Because, seriously, you're like

1060
00:25:46,332 --> 00:25:47,591
a completely different person, these days.

1061
00:25:50,449 --> 00:25:50,487
Sorry, it's this case. It's a bitch.

1062
00:25:53,196 --> 00:25:56,342
I got upset, so I asked you to come get me.

1063
00:25:57,725 --> 00:25:58,895
I didn't say I minded.

1064
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,331
Look, we need to spend some time together,

1065
00:26:05,781 --> 00:26:05,831
figure out what's suddenly going on with us

1066
00:26:09,416 --> 00:26:10,123
because most of it, I like,

1067
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:20,223
a lot.

1068
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:27,292
Paul.

1069
00:26:28,931 --> 00:26:42,557
Think about it.

1070
00:26:43,533 --> 00:26:43,539
So,

1071
00:26:46,311 --> 00:26:46,599
the woman Beth shot andHelena are connected.

1072
00:26:47,775 --> 00:26:47,844
Holy watershed.

1073
00:26:49,995 --> 00:26:50,115
Okay, Beth probably shotMaggie Chen on purpose.

1074
00:26:52,085 --> 00:26:52,154
She never told us anything about this.

1075
00:26:54,056 --> 00:26:54,176
Yeah, she never told her partner, either.

1076
00:26:56,696 --> 00:26:56,715
I can't keep doing this, Cosima.

1077
00:26:59,036 --> 00:26:59,156
Helena was here. She was Beth.

1078
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,852
She's going to get us both busted,unless I meet her, alone.

1079
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:04,585
Oh, my God. Bad idea.

1080
00:27:06,769 --> 00:27:06,806
Yeah, she thinks we have a connection.

1081
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:07,790
Do you?

1082
00:27:09,096 --> 00:27:09,165
Yeah, we're clones.

1083
00:27:11,944 --> 00:27:11,994
Right. So what do the cops know?

1084
00:27:14,603 --> 00:27:14,671
She's a churchy psychopath. Duh.

1085
00:27:16,298 --> 00:27:16,317
It's personal.

1086
00:27:18,796 --> 00:27:18,801
She's a loner, probably abused as a child.

1087
00:27:20,252 --> 00:27:20,372
Okay, so,

1088
00:27:21,704 --> 00:27:21,735
the fish

1089
00:27:23,043 --> 00:27:23,087
reads Christian

1090
00:27:25,696 --> 00:27:25,752
and, crafted onto a weapon?

1091
00:27:27,422 --> 00:27:27,466
A personal crusade.

1092
00:27:29,043 --> 00:27:29,163
Great. Is that it?

1093
00:27:30,741 --> 00:27:30,757
You know, when I'm seeing this

1094
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:33,084
branded onto Maggie Chen, I'm thinking that

1095
00:27:34,242 --> 00:27:34,304
she's not a lone warrior.

1096
00:27:36,331 --> 00:27:36,369
To extreme creationist types,

1097
00:27:38,121 --> 00:27:38,127
we would be abominations.

1098
00:27:40,723 --> 00:27:40,974
Like, not God's children,but, but, Satan's.

1099
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:44,433
So they hate us and she's killing us,

1100
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:47,005
even though she's identical to us?

1101
00:27:49,463 --> 00:27:51,359
Well, but if you were amessed-up, abused lonerwhose faith compelled you

1102
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:57,334
to belong and somebody that you trustedtold you that this was
the way to redeem yourself

1103
00:27:57,388 --> 00:27:59,530
in the eyes of God, I mean...

1104
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,270
Yeah, I might become an angry angel, too.

1105
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,329
Okay, got it. Thanks.

1106
00:28:10,167 --> 00:28:11,643
Something you want to tell me?

1107
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:13,145
About Paul?

1108
00:28:13,201 --> 00:28:16,054
No. I've got him wrappedaround my little finger.

1109
00:28:16,098 --> 00:28:18,557
What's he talking about, leaving?

1110
00:28:18,677 --> 00:28:20,102
We just got you back, Beth.

1111
00:28:20,644 --> 00:28:22,498
No, he doesn't knowwhat he's talking about.

1112
00:28:22,713 --> 00:28:24,312
Things are just messy right now.

1113
00:28:24,315 --> 00:28:25,457
Yeah, I heard that.

1114
00:28:25,514 --> 00:28:28,079
But we don't bring thatshit in here, right?

1115
00:28:28,118 --> 00:28:28,967
I know.

1116
00:28:29,219 --> 00:28:30,431
It's so frickin' embarrassing.

1117
00:28:30,437 --> 00:28:32,483
Don't worry. It won't happen again.

1118
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,643
I thought you two were calling it quits.

1119
00:28:35,862 --> 00:28:38,077
Yeah, we were, but, now,

1120
00:28:38,102 --> 00:28:39,394
we're trying to work it out.

1121
00:28:40,763 --> 00:28:42,620
You know how things go.

1122
00:28:43,233 --> 00:28:44,684
Right.

1123
00:28:45,297 --> 00:28:46,912
Let's get back on track.

1124
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:48,745
This killer.

1125
00:28:48,865 --> 00:28:50,403
You had a close-quartersrun-in with her.

1126
00:28:50,409 --> 00:28:51,811
Did you get anything else?

1127
00:28:51,879 --> 00:28:53,394
Something she said?

1128
00:28:53,419 --> 00:28:54,777
If she'd said anything,

1129
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,874
I would've known she was a woman.

1130
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:01,585
Yeah. I'm going to check with Beckwith.

1131
00:29:03,719 --> 00:29:03,721
She's making progress on Jane Doe.

1132
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:04,424
Mm.

1133
00:29:06,207 --> 00:29:07,289
She'll have facial reconstruction soon.

1134
00:29:08,857 --> 00:29:15,022
Great.

1135
00:29:16,048 --> 00:29:16,724
Detective Childs.

1136
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:20,671
Things must be gettinguncomfortable there for you now.

1137
00:29:21,691 --> 00:29:21,735
Helena,

1138
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:24,582
you forgot something. Your friend Maggie.

1139
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:28,011
Oh, you're a terrible detective.

1140
00:29:29,692 --> 00:29:29,812
Beth figured that out.

1141
00:29:31,946 --> 00:29:33,385
Well, Beth shot her, not me,if it's revenge you're after.

1142
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:35,406
It's not about revenge.

1143
00:29:35,863 --> 00:29:37,195
It's about you.

1144
00:29:37,315 --> 00:29:39,729
Right, we have a connection.

1145
00:29:41,425 --> 00:29:42,789
You want to tell me about that?

1146
00:29:42,826 --> 00:29:44,384
In person.

1147
00:29:45,104 --> 00:29:47,249
You have my invitation.

1148
00:29:57,022 --> 00:30:00,859
My name is Detective Beth Childs.

1149
00:30:01,141 --> 00:30:04,544
I murdered Margaret Chen.

1150
00:30:04,664 --> 00:30:07,303
It wasn't an accident.

1151
00:30:07,353 --> 00:30:10,044
I shot her on purpose.

1152
00:30:29,188 --> 00:30:30,915
I'm gasping for a fag.

1153
00:30:33,361 --> 00:30:33,818
No, you're not. Sarah never smoked.

1154
00:30:35,345 --> 00:30:35,676
Okay, it's curtain time.

1155
00:30:37,047 --> 00:30:37,053
So just remember that

1156
00:30:38,917 --> 00:30:38,923
an insult is a greeting,

1157
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:40,725
but you're trying not tolose your temper, yeah?

1158
00:30:42,445 --> 00:30:44,322
Mm-hmm.

1159
00:30:47,663 --> 00:30:49,453
Wait. Um, thanks.

1160
00:30:50,873 --> 00:30:52,070
Okay.

1161
00:30:53,738 --> 00:30:53,751
Over-slouching.You're over-slouching.

1162
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:55,453
Shut up.

1163
00:30:56,923 --> 00:30:59,056
Now you got it.

1164
00:31:01,096 --> 00:31:03,154
Oi-oi, Mrs S!

1165
00:31:05,657 --> 00:31:05,777
Not driving the nice new Jag today, then?

1166
00:31:07,903 --> 00:31:08,254
- It's in the shop.- Mm-hmm.

1167
00:31:10,784 --> 00:31:19,323
Are you going to let mesee my daughter, or what?

1168
00:31:20,975 --> 00:31:40,238
What are you gaping at?

1169
00:31:41,884 --> 00:31:43,617
Something I can do?

1170
00:31:44,868 --> 00:31:44,918
You ever fight a woman?

1171
00:31:47,308 --> 00:31:47,696
Depends. Business or pleasure?

1172
00:31:49,692 --> 00:31:50,055
Look, they do say crazy makes you strong.

1173
00:31:52,895 --> 00:31:53,239
But women, they look different,

1174
00:31:56,317 --> 00:31:56,517
fight different, smell different.

1175
00:31:58,275 --> 00:31:58,313
This woman is a trained sniper.

1176
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:00,409
But Beth taking her for a man,

1177
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:04,963
- that flies with you?- Mm.

1178
00:32:06,321 --> 00:32:06,340
This whole time, it feels like she's got

1179
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:08,329
something else chewing on her mind.

1180
00:32:10,212 --> 00:32:10,214
You know, a civilianshooting's hard to shake.

1181
00:32:11,958 --> 00:32:13,691
Maybe she's back too soon.I don't know if that's even it.

1182
00:32:13,735 --> 00:32:15,512
Where is she, anyway?

1183
00:32:26,014 --> 00:32:28,579
Could be she's just working itout with her boyfriend, right?

1184
00:32:28,617 --> 00:32:30,988
Yeah, could be.

1185
00:32:37,536 --> 00:32:39,544
- What?- Nothing.

1186
00:32:50,611 --> 00:32:52,576
So what, now, invisible ink?

1187
00:33:05,569 --> 00:33:07,122
Mind the store, Angie.

1188
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,787
Maybe I should come with.

1189
00:33:09,006 --> 00:33:10,801
Come on, Art. What's up?

1190
00:33:10,921 --> 00:33:12,684
You'll know when I do.

1191
00:33:30,691 --> 00:33:33,077
Kira, your mum's waiting.

1192
00:33:33,197 --> 00:33:35,252
Hurry up, love. Come on.

1193
00:33:41,805 --> 00:33:44,475
Here she is. Look, she's here.

1194
00:33:46,183 --> 00:33:48,210
She won't bite, love.

1195
00:33:51,964 --> 00:33:54,360
Oi, are you shy now, or something?

1196
00:33:56,756 --> 00:33:57,782
Is that for me?

1197
00:34:00,123 --> 00:34:01,643
Can I see it?

1198
00:34:06,823 --> 00:34:08,731
How about a cuppa in the kitchen, yeah?

1199
00:34:08,733 --> 00:34:10,099
Wow!

1200
00:34:14,193 --> 00:34:15,371
Give us a hug?

1201
00:34:20,181 --> 00:34:21,407
I'm sorry we haven't

1202
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:23,309
seen each other in a long time,

1203
00:34:23,322 --> 00:34:24,992
but we can change all that,

1204
00:34:25,055 --> 00:34:27,107
see each other all the time?

1205
00:34:29,278 --> 00:34:30,586
You're not my mother.

1206
00:34:38,613 --> 00:34:40,671
Silly.

1207
00:34:40,791 --> 00:34:42,435
Of course I'm your mum.

1208
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,362
Who else would I be?

1209
00:34:49,392 --> 00:34:51,075
You just look like her.

1210
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:57,880
It's still me, Kira.

1211
00:34:57,882 --> 00:34:59,796
What do you call me?

1212
00:35:00,071 --> 00:35:01,323
Monkey.

1213
00:35:01,341 --> 00:35:02,430
What else?

1214
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:06,196
Monkey... bum?

1215
00:35:07,059 --> 00:35:08,010
Face?

1216
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,399
Where's my mum?

1217
00:35:13,228 --> 00:35:15,998
Art, if you're hearing this,

1218
00:35:16,588 --> 00:35:18,108
you found the body.

1219
00:35:18,778 --> 00:35:21,856
It's not Beth. It's me.

1220
00:35:23,126 --> 00:35:25,590
My name is Sarah Manning and...

1221
00:35:26,036 --> 00:35:28,519
you're about the only person I trust

1222
00:35:28,544 --> 00:35:30,584
to figure the whole thing out.

1223
00:35:33,475 --> 00:35:36,252
Kira, your mothercouldn't be here right now.

1224
00:35:36,446 --> 00:35:37,767
Why?

1225
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,669
Police! Stay inside!

1226
00:35:56,841 --> 00:35:58,993
Because she is out there, right now,

1227
00:35:59,061 --> 00:36:01,132
doing something very brave.

1228
00:36:01,178 --> 00:36:04,681
She's making sure everything is safe

1229
00:36:04,699 --> 00:36:06,589
so you two can be together.

1230
00:36:25,035 --> 00:36:26,571
I'm unarmed.

1231
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:34,541
Turn around.

1232
00:36:35,636 --> 00:36:37,964
Turn around! All the way.

1233
00:36:39,734 --> 00:36:41,029
Kneel.

1234
00:36:41,619 --> 00:36:43,500
I'm guessing you know how.

1235
00:36:44,907 --> 00:36:48,010
This isn't necessary. Kneel down.

1236
00:36:50,024 --> 00:36:52,220
You're different than the others.

1237
00:36:52,496 --> 00:36:54,096
Yeah, I am.

1238
00:36:55,486 --> 00:36:56,700
Uh!

1239
00:36:57,269 --> 00:36:59,478
You wanted to talk? Let's talk.

1240
00:37:00,661 --> 00:37:02,031
I think I'm dying.

1241
00:37:04,284 --> 00:37:05,779
Yeah, I think I'll watch.

1242
00:37:13,669 --> 00:37:15,084
Where did you come from?

1243
00:37:16,097 --> 00:37:17,629
I came out of the woodwork.

1244
00:37:17,749 --> 00:37:19,019
Where did you come from?

1245
00:37:19,207 --> 00:37:20,389
God sent me.

1246
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,658
Right, so you don't know, either.

1247
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,206
You don't know God.

1248
00:37:24,237 --> 00:37:25,794
This God?

1249
00:37:26,083 --> 00:37:28,598
The one branded on your friend Maggie Chen?

1250
00:37:28,718 --> 00:37:31,895
Maggie helped make you.

1251
00:37:34,811 --> 00:37:36,525
Then she saw the light

1252
00:37:36,894 --> 00:37:38,540
and came to our side.

1253
00:37:39,497 --> 00:37:41,594
Beth killed her to protect us.

1254
00:37:41,938 --> 00:37:43,533
I can save you.

1255
00:37:44,572 --> 00:37:46,215
Right, because we have a connection.

1256
00:37:46,217 --> 00:37:48,251
I can see a light in you.

1257
00:37:48,294 --> 00:37:49,884
There's a light in all of us.

1258
00:37:50,004 --> 00:37:51,153
No!

1259
00:37:51,273 --> 00:37:52,824
N... no!

1260
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,070
The others,

1261
00:37:55,095 --> 00:37:57,759
poor copies of God's image of human beings.

1262
00:37:58,062 --> 00:37:59,543
But not you?

1263
00:38:00,049 --> 00:38:01,397
You're special?

1264
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,034
They told you you werethe original, didn't they?

1265
00:38:20,985 --> 00:38:21,998
You people!

1266
00:38:22,173 --> 00:38:24,476
It's not true, what they said!

1267
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,291
We're genetic identicals.

1268
00:38:26,334 --> 00:38:27,742
Let me save you.

1269
00:38:27,748 --> 00:38:31,011
You, me, Beth, the German you killed!

1270
00:38:32,362 --> 00:38:33,113
We're all made the same.

1271
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:34,689
Whoever told you different

1272
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:36,747
hates you as much as they hate us.

1273
00:38:37,817 --> 00:38:41,471
You're wrong.

1274
00:38:43,505 --> 00:38:47,777
What happened to you, Helena?

1275
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:56,211
Stay back!

1276
00:38:57,869 --> 00:39:02,443
Can you feel it?

1277
00:39:03,857 --> 00:39:10,088
Beth!

1278
00:39:11,045 --> 00:39:13,078
Beth!

1279
00:39:14,048 --> 00:39:16,320
Beth!

1280
00:39:18,303 --> 00:39:23,258
Beth, are you in there?

1281
00:39:24,443 --> 00:39:28,815
Run!

1282
00:39:30,953 --> 00:39:43,208
You don't feel it?

1283
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:45,800
- There's no one here!- You're here.

1284
00:39:46,893 --> 00:39:48,301
Why?

1285
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:50,290
Beth!

1286
00:39:52,404 --> 00:39:52,749
The apartment of the woman you killed?

1287
00:39:54,783 --> 00:39:59,513
What the hell are you thinking?

1288
00:40:01,314 --> 00:40:01,434
How can you be my auntie Alison?

1289
00:40:03,473 --> 00:40:03,517
My mum doesn't have any sisters.

1290
00:40:05,466 --> 00:40:05,807
My mum doesn't even have a mum.

1291
00:40:08,436 --> 00:40:09,774
Well, it's very complicated.

1292
00:40:11,883 --> 00:40:13,228
But, Kira, I'm sorry about this,but it's very important

1293
00:40:13,266 --> 00:40:16,275
that you keep this a secret, right?

1294
00:40:17,226 --> 00:40:18,471
Promise?

1295
00:40:20,004 --> 00:40:21,794
Getting on for bedtime, Kira, love.

1296
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,489
Up you go. Get your PJs.

1297
00:40:25,717 --> 00:40:27,807
Pinkies.

1298
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,140
Bye, mummy.

1299
00:40:37,831 --> 00:40:39,118
Scoot.

1300
00:40:41,741 --> 00:40:43,299
Thanks for everything.

1301
00:40:43,343 --> 00:40:44,838
Well, you kept your word. You showed up.

1302
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:46,452
I mean Kira.

1303
00:40:47,115 --> 00:40:50,619
She's well and that's, uh, down to you.

1304
00:40:51,299 --> 00:40:52,677
Sarah.

1305
00:40:54,168 --> 00:40:55,656
I'm just, uh,

1306
00:40:55,776 --> 00:40:58,559
I'm not used to an honestword on the subject.

1307
00:41:02,231 --> 00:41:04,777
Um, I'd like to do this again,

1308
00:41:04,834 --> 00:41:06,417
sooner, rather than later.

1309
00:41:06,537 --> 00:41:09,048
I'm not opposed, long as we take it slowly.

1310
00:41:10,308 --> 00:41:11,810
So, I'll be by tomorrow

1311
00:41:13,236 --> 00:41:14,400
to walk her home from school.

1312
00:41:15,733 --> 00:41:16,559
Straight home.

1313
00:41:18,023 --> 00:41:19,006
Well, all right, then.

1314
00:41:20,477 --> 00:41:20,896
Well, unleash the doves.

1315
00:41:23,474 --> 00:41:23,737
World peace must beright around the corner.

1316
00:41:25,695 --> 00:41:33,272
Piss off, you.

1317
00:41:36,188 --> 00:41:37,063
Well, aren't you full of surprises.You passed!

1318
00:41:37,114 --> 00:41:39,347
You turned S's head for your Uncle. Mwah!

1319
00:41:39,384 --> 00:41:41,123
Well, that's something.

1320
00:41:41,449 --> 00:41:42,907
Uh-oh.

1321
00:41:43,107 --> 00:41:44,699
Kira knew right away.

1322
00:41:44,819 --> 00:41:46,373
No.

1323
00:41:47,223 --> 00:41:48,721
Oh, shite!

1324
00:41:55,682 --> 00:41:56,795
I just don't get it.

1325
00:41:56,797 --> 00:41:58,509
It doesn't make any sense to me.

1326
00:41:58,899 --> 00:42:00,874
Just explain to us why you were

1327
00:42:02,414 --> 00:42:02,595
at the home of Maggie Chen.

1328
00:42:05,467 --> 00:42:05,880
Like I said, I was taking a walk

1329
00:42:07,894 --> 00:42:07,901
to clear my head. I found myself there.

1330
00:42:09,918 --> 00:42:10,038
You just found yourself there? Yeah.

1331
00:42:12,352 --> 00:42:15,247
"Yes" or "no"... isthere a connection betweenthe Maggie Chen shooting death
and this Jane Doe homicide?

1332
00:42:15,249 --> 00:42:16,582
None.

1333
00:42:17,056 --> 00:42:18,684
Well, you called this meeting, Beth.

1334
00:42:18,804 --> 00:42:20,319
What the hell are we doing here?

1335
00:42:21,448 --> 00:42:24,702
After the Chen thing, I cameback to prove that I could,

1336
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:27,893
but I'm not doing anybody any good, so,

1337
00:42:29,207 --> 00:42:30,829
I quit.

1338
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:34,118
After all we've done for you?

1339
00:42:34,168 --> 00:42:35,549
Yeah. I appreciate it, but...

1340
00:42:35,582 --> 00:42:38,003
But you bail. Why?

1341
00:42:38,265 --> 00:42:40,368
What is it with you?!

1342
00:42:40,737 --> 00:42:43,175
Walking out's not the answer, Childs.

1343
00:42:43,514 --> 00:42:45,043
So how does this go?

1344
00:42:48,188 --> 00:42:50,021
Something like this?

1345
00:43:38,014 --> 00:43:39,398
What'll they do to me?

1346
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,666
This is about Paul, right?

1347
00:43:40,668 --> 00:43:42,935
We think Beth was spying on him.

1348
00:43:42,937 --> 00:43:44,477
She wasn't messing around, was she?

1349
00:43:44,505 --> 00:43:46,672
Maybe it's time to findout where Paul works.

1350
00:43:46,674 --> 00:43:48,382
What happened to your scar?

1351
00:43:48,776 --> 00:43:50,352
Why were you in my vanity?

1352
00:43:50,472 --> 00:43:52,960
- Donnie, what's in the box?!- I don't know who you are.

1353
00:43:52,968 --> 00:43:55,014
Sarah, I thought you were dead!

1354
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:56,628
Is someone trying to hurt us?

1355
00:43:56,748 --> 00:43:58,029
Why do you ask that?

1356
00:44:00,073 --> 00:44:01,520
How could you do that to her?
